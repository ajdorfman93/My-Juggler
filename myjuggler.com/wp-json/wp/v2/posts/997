It\u2019s actually beneficial\u00a0to worry about things sometimes. It helps us identify potential problems. But worry can become problematic\u00a0when it\u2019s persistent.<\/p>\n<p>Excessive\u00a0worrying can hurt your well-being\u00a0and lead to\u00a0a state of chronic\u00a0anxiety or stress.\u00a0It can also\u00a0stress\u00a0your relationships, harm your\u00a0self-confidence, and hurt your\u00a0career.\u00a0And stopping worrying is not always easy, either.<\/p>\n<p>Worry involves negative thought patterns \u2014 patterns that we&#8217;ve used over and over again. This can make\u00a0them deeply ingrained\u00a0in our brains. So stopping worrying involves\u00a0confronting\u00a0our\u00a0beliefs,\u00a0values, and emotions. Here are\u00a0five\u00a0steps you can use to\u00a0put an end to worrying.<\/p>\n<p><strong>1. Explore the origins of your worry.\u00a0<\/strong>One way you can tell whether your worry is about the situation you&#8217;re in or the way you think is by exploring whether the worry is general or specific.\u00a0If you worry about one specific thing (e.g., work, kids, money) but you don&#8217;t worry about everything, you\u00a0should consider taking constructive action to change your situation.<\/p>\n<p>But\u00a0if you&#8217;re like me, and you worry about just about everything, then working on your &#8220;worrying thoughts&#8221; is a good first step.\u00a0Either way, it&#8217;s good\u00a0to investigate\u00a0the origins of your worry so you can gain\u00a0self-awareness.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2. Identify your unique worry patterns.\u00a0<\/strong>Here are some thought patterns that lead to worry. Some people will find that they have all of these patterns; other people will just have a few. But by understanding what thoughts cause our worries, we can more easily resolve them.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Catastrophizing\u00a0<\/strong>is when we expect the worst possible outcomes.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Minimization\u00a0<\/strong>is when we downplay the good things.<\/li>\n<li><strong>All-or-nothing thinking<\/strong>\u00a0is when we interpret a situation as all good or all bad.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Overgeneralization<\/strong>\u00a0is when we believe that having one negative experience\u00a0means we will always have this negative experience.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Negative\u00a0attention<\/strong>\u00a0is when we focus on the negative things that went wrong rather than\u00a0focusing on the positive things.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Rumination\u00a0<\/strong>is when we think about something distressing over and over again<\/li>\n<li><strong>Mind reading\u00a0<\/strong>is when we believe we know what others are thinking even though we haven&#8217;t actually asked them what they think.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Ask yourself: Which of these thought patterns do you have?<\/p>\n<p><strong>3. Stop worry\u00a0by moving your body.\u00a0<\/strong>When you worry, your sympathetic\u00a0nervous system\u00a0is activated (it&#8217;s the fight or flight system).\u00a0Even if you completely stop worrying, it\u00a0won&#8217;t get those neurochemicals out of your body right away. That&#8217;s why cardiovascular exercise can really help with worry.<\/p>\n<p>Exercise activates the parasympathetic nervous system\u00a0(in the longer term) which\u00a0relieves stress\u00a0and helps calm the\u00a0body, returning it to\u00a0its emotional baseline.<\/p>\n<p><strong>4. Try\u00a0mindfulness\u00a0to calm worries.\u00a0<\/strong>The next step to\u00a0stop worrying\u00a0is by\u00a0cultivating mindfulness. By sitting quietly, noticing your thoughts, and letting them go, mindfulness can help redirect worries.\u00a0Over time, mindfulness\u00a0can train the mind to\u00a0calm the body so you don&#8217;t get so\u00a0stuck in worries.<\/p>\n<p>To practice\u00a0mindfulness meditation\u00a0all you need is a comfy spot. I find that a mediation video helps me stay focused while doing mindfulness.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Here&#8217;s a helpful mindfulness meditation video for a worried mind:<\/strong><\/p>\n<div class=\"youtube-embed-wrapper\">\n<div class=\"fluid-width-video-wrapper\">\n<p><iframe title=\"Sleep Meditation: Release Worry Guided Meditation Hypnosis for a Deep Sleep &amp; Relaxation\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/jcdBCam2pnU?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><strong>5. Talk to someone about your worries.\u00a0<\/strong>Talking with a\u00a0trusted counselor\u00a0or friend\u00a0can help you gain more perspective on your worry\u2014<em>Is it really worth worrying about? How can you think about this situation differently?\u00a0<\/em>Keeping your worries\u00a0to yourself can lead\u00a0them to build up and become overwhelming. By talking to someone, you can release some of the pressure.<\/p>\n<p>But be cautious of who you talk to about your worries. Other worriers may make things worse. So just be thoughtful about who you share your worries with.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Worries are completely\u00a0normal.
