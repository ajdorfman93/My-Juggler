And why do others, whose partners seem hopelessly mismatched, grow stronger? Much research has tried to identify the individual characteristics that make for a successful relationship, including\u00a0how couples deal with conflict or communicate. All shed some light on what may underlie relationship success. But a\u00a0<a class=\"ext\" href=\"https:\/\/www.sciencealert.com\/ai-analysed-over-11-000-couples-relationships-this-is-what-it-found\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">new study of over 11,000 couples<\/a>\u00a0reveals a key ingredient that\u2019s easily overlooked or ignored \u2014 and it\u2019s the major predictor of relationship\u00a0<a class=\"inline-links topic-link\" title=\"Psychology Today looks at happiness\" href=\"https:\/\/www.psychologytoday.com\/intl\/basics\/happiness\">happiness<\/a>, romantic\u00a0<a class=\"inline-links topic-link\" title=\"Psychology Today looks at intimacy\" href=\"https:\/\/www.psychologytoday.com\/intl\/basics\/relationships\">intimacy<\/a>, and connection.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s not how well two prospective partners matched up on a\u00a0<a class=\"inline-links topic-link\" title=\"Psychology Today looks at dating\" href=\"https:\/\/www.psychologytoday.com\/intl\/basics\/mating\">dating<\/a>\u00a0site. It\u2019s not about\u00a0<a class=\"inline-links topic-link\" title=\"Psychology Today looks at personality\" href=\"https:\/\/www.psychologytoday.com\/intl\/basics\/personality\">personality<\/a>\u00a0features, personal history, or interests. These do play a role in predicting long-term relationship success, but the study found they play a much smaller role than one might think.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>What\u2019s the \u201cSecret?\u201d\u00a0 \u00a0<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Simply put, the research found that strongest predictor is the kind of relationship the partners create together, over time. That is, the\u00a0<em>quality<\/em>\u00a0of the relationship they experience transcends individual traits or characteristics in predicting the couple\u2019s happiness over time.<\/p>\n<p>The\u00a0<a class=\"ext\" href=\"https:\/\/www.sciencealert.com\/ai-analysed-over-11-000-couples-relationships-this-is-what-it-found\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">study, from Canada\u2019s Western University,<\/a>\u00a0was based on a different kind of analysis of information from\u00a043 studies of the 11,000 couples. As lead author\u00a0<a class=\"ext\" href=\"https:\/\/www.inverse.com\/mind-body\/dating-study-predicts-happy-relationships\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Samantha Joel stated,<\/a>\u00a0\u201cIt suggests that the person we choose is not nearly as important as the relationship we build.\u201d It&#8217;s the overall way the partners relate\u00a0to each other. The research shows, she adds, that &#8220;the dynamic that you build with someone \u2014 the shared norms, the in-jokes, the shared experiences \u2014 is so much more than the separate individuals who make up that relationship.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The study looked at individual characteristics that you might assume to be the most important predictors of a happy relationship, like the individual partner\u2019s feelings about their life situation, their tendency toward\u00a0<a class=\"inline-links topic-link\" title=\"Psychology Today looks at anxiety\" href=\"https:\/\/www.psychologytoday.com\/intl\/basics\/anxiety\">anxiety<\/a>\u00a0or\u00a0<a class=\"inline-links topic-link\" title=\"Psychology Today looks at depression\" href=\"https:\/\/www.psychologytoday.com\/intl\/basics\/depression\">depression<\/a>, their\u00a0<a class=\"inline-links topic-link\" title=\"Psychology Today looks at attachment\" href=\"https:\/\/www.psychologytoday.com\/intl\/basics\/attachment\">attachment<\/a>\u00a0pattern, or whether their parents had a stable\u00a0<a class=\"inline-links topic-link\" title=\"Psychology Today looks at marriage\" href=\"https:\/\/www.psychologytoday.com\/intl\/basics\/marriage\">marriage<\/a>\u00a0or\u00a0<a class=\"inline-links topic-link\" title=\"Psychology Today looks at divorce\" href=\"https:\/\/www.psychologytoday.com\/intl\/basics\/divorce\">divorce<\/a>. Those factors can have a negative impact on the relationship, of course. But the research found that they were much less significant for happiness than the actual pattern of the ongoing relationship \u2014 that is,\u00a0how they interact, and how each feels about the interaction. The pleasure and enjoyment of just being together.<\/p>\n<p>That core feature\u00a0includes, for example:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>A mutual sense of strong commitment to each other; and responsiveness to each other\u2019s needs: \u201cI know he\/she has my back.\u201d<\/li>\n<li>A mutual level of enjoyment with their\u00a0<a class=\"inline-links topic-link\" title=\"Psychology Today looks at sex\" href=\"https:\/\/www.psychologytoday.com\/intl\/basics\/sex\">sex<\/a>\u00a0life.<\/li>\n<li>A sense that their partner was happy with their relationship, and an infrequent, low level of conflict with each other.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>All of those findings from the empirical study match what we see clinically, as well, among couples that develop long-term, sustained pleasure in their relationships.\u00a0The study was published in\u00a0<a class=\"ext\" href=\"https:\/\/www.pnas.org\/content\/117\/32\/19061\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>PNAS, the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>How Couples Build It<\/h2>\n<p>What the research can\u2019t show, of course, is how such couples\u00a0\u201cgrow\u201d that kind bond of connection, trust, and pleasure. Here, both empirical and clinical research point to some of what they do to create a positive dynamic.<\/p>\n<p>Overall, the most encompassing is their\u00a0commitment to ongoing\u00a0<a class=\"inline-links topic-link\" title=\"Psychology Today looks at openness\" href=\"https:\/\/www.psychologytoday.com\/intl\/basics\/openness\">openness<\/a>\u00a0and exposure to each other \u2013 mutually revealing their hopes, fears, desires, and sense of where they want to go \u2014 as two separate individuals joined together in this journey through life.\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.psychologytoday.com\/intl\/blog\/the-new-resilience\/201208\/is-radical-transparency-the-key-relationship-success?collection=1071101\">I described here<\/a>\u00a0how couples do that through a\u00a0practice of\u00a0\u201cRadical Transparency.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>There is some corroborating evidence from empirical research. For example:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>A willingness to forgo personal interests and knowing when to put\u00a0your partner&#8217;s needs ahead of your own. Letting go of self-interest in this\u00a0way\u00a0is directly linked to a long-lasting, happy relationship. Staying entrenched in your own ego won&#8217;t do it, as I\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.psychologytoday.com\/intl\/blog\/the-new-resilience\/201104\/why-relationship-advice-fails-improve-your-relationship\">wrote about here<\/a>, and is reflected in research by\u00a0<a class=\"inline-links topic-link\" title=\"Psychology Today looks at John Gottman\" href=\"https:\/\/www.psychologytoday.com\/intl\/therapy-types\/the-gottman-method\">John Gottman<\/a>\u00a0and others.<\/li>\n<li>Feeling\u00a0appreciated and valued by your partner. That\u00a0tends to strengthen your\u00a0marriage\u00a0or committed relationship,\u00a0and it increases your belief\u00a0about how enduring your relationship will be over time.\u00a0This was found in a\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/https\/\/www.psychologytoday.com\/intl\/blog\/the-new-resilience\/201511\/does-showing-gratitude-have-any-impact-your-relationship\">University of Georgia study that I wrote about here.\u00a0<\/a><\/li>\n<li>A\u00a0different\u00a0study I cited in\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.psychologytoday.com\/intl\/blog\/the-new-resilience\/201804\/how-make-love-first-sight-last\">this post,\u00a0conducted at Wake Forest University,<\/a>\u00a0found that your relationship is strengthened when your\u00a0<a class=\"inline-links topic-link\" title=\"Psychology Today looks at stressed-out\" href=\"https:\/\/www.psychologytoday.com\/intl\/basics\/stress\">stressed-out<\/a>\u00a0partner feels really understood and listened to.
