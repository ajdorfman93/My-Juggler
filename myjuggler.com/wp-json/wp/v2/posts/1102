When you sense something that seems threatening, your body releases cortisol, the stress\u00a0<a class=\"inline-links topic-link\" title=\"Psychology Today looks at hormone\" href=\"https:\/\/www.psychologytoday.com\/us\/basics\/hormones\">hormone<\/a>\u00a0that springs your body into action. This is called the stress response. For our ancient ancestors, this meant being on the ready to fight, take flight, or freeze (play dead) when facing scary threats, such as a fearsome saber-tooth tiger.<\/p>\n<p>While in modern life you thankfully don\u2019t meet any saber-toothed tigers, everyday challenges can still make you feel very\u00a0<a class=\"inline-links topic-link\" title=\"Psychology Today looks at anxious\" href=\"https:\/\/www.psychologytoday.com\/us\/basics\/anxiety\">anxious<\/a>\u2014thanks to your old-school reacting brain. Usually two words driven by our anxious minds\u2014What If?\u2014lead the charge.<\/p>\n<p>Examples of &#8220;What If&#8217;s&#8221; in modern-day life include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Work demands:\u00a0<\/strong><em>&#8220;This new boss is so demanding and seems impossible to please! What if I lose my job?&#8221;<\/em><\/li>\n<li><strong>Time constraints:\u00a0<\/strong><em>&#8220;What if I can&#8217;t supervise my\u00a0son&#8217;s virtual schooling\u00a0(or get him to in-person school) and be at\u00a0work on time?&#8221;<\/em><\/li>\n<li><strong>Relationship pressures:\u00a0<\/strong><em>&#8220;He is so nice but what if he dumps me?&#8221;<\/em><\/li>\n<li><strong>Societal pressures:<\/strong><em>\u00a0&#8220;I am so scared about these tumultuous times we live in! What if\u00a0this country falls apart?&#8221;<\/em><\/li>\n<li><strong>Information overload:\u00a0<\/strong><em>&#8220;Shoot, I thought I saw your text, I meant to respond, so sorry this slipped through! What if things like this keep falling\u00a0through the cracks?&#8221;<\/em><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Your Reacting Brain Can Be Tamed by Your Thinking Brain<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Fortunately, there&#8217;s another part of your brain, called the prefrontal cortex: the \u201cthinking\u201d part. The main job of the prefrontal cortex is to provide logical thinking to help control your emotional responses to stress so that you don\u2019t get too\u00a0<a class=\"inline-links topic-link\" title=\"Psychology Today looks at stressed\" href=\"https:\/\/www.psychologytoday.com\/us\/basics\/stress\">stressed<\/a>\u00a0out and overreact. If you place your finger on your forehead,\u00a0you\u2019ll be about as close as you can get to touching your prefrontal cortex.<\/p>\n<p>Your prefrontal cortex can rein in your stress response, slowing down the release of cortisol\u2014if it determines that whatever your amygdala is freaking out about is not in fact a threat, or if it recognizes that the situation is manageable. This logical thinking part of your brain is very important for helping you manage anxiety and not overreact. This\u00a0helps\u00a0you make good choices. And as you\u2019ll see, often when you feel stressed out, you have to consciously remember to turn to your thinking brain to gain back control from your reacting brain.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The 7-Word Question That Comes to the Rescue<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Realizing how\u00a0\u201cWhat-ifs\u201d can really get your mind racing, you can use the power of &#8220;What is the worst thing that can happen?&#8221; \u00a0to slow them down. The following sanity-saving activity is from my latest book,\u00a0<a class=\"ext\" href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Anxiety-Depression-Anger-Toolbox-Teens\/dp\/1683732715\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>The Anxiety, Depression, and Anger Toolbox for Teens<\/em><\/a>, but it is applicable for all ages:<\/p>\n<p>Close your eyes and reflect on the \u201cwhat-ifs\u201d that you have struggled with in the past and those that still come into your mind. Fill in the \u201cwhat-ifs\u201d blanks below. As you do so, reflect on each \u201cWhat-if,&#8221; and think about how it gets in your way. Now think in earnest about this commonly undervalued, seven-word question, which is your antidote to stress and anxiety: &#8220;What &#8216;s the worst thing that can happen?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s an example to help you get started:<\/p>\n<p><em>What if I lose my job while trying to take care of my kids during this pandemic?<\/em><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;T<em>he worst thing that could happen is I will have to look for another job, which may be more suited to balancing the current demands in my life. And even if it ends up taking me longer than I&#8217;d like to get a new job, it helps to remind myself about those times in the past when I have discovered ways to cope in\u00a0really hard times. Actually, now thinking about this all more reasonably, I think I am going to proactively speak to my supervisor and see if there is something we can work out to make this current situation more manageable for me.<\/em>&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Now, fill in the blanks below and give the power of this seven-word question a try for some of the stressors you would like to manage better:<\/p>\n<p>What if ____________________________________________________________________?<\/p>\n<p>The worst thing that could happen is\u00a0 _____________________________________________ __________________________________________________________________________<\/p>\n<p>What if ____________________________________________________________________?<\/p>\n<p>The worst thing that could happen is\u00a0 _____________________________________________ __________________________________________________________________________<\/p>\n<p>What if ____________________________________________________________________?<\/p>\n<div class=\"markup-replacement-slot markup-replacement-slot-8\" data-slot-position=\"8\"><\/div>\n<p>The worst thing that could happen is\u00a0 _____________________________________________ __________________________________________________________________________<\/p>\n<div style=\"background: #fafafa; font-size: 0.85em; padding: 1em;\">\n<p><strong>References<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Bernstein, J.
