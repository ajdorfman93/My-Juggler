In the future, some experts believe, people will embrace a more complex definition of happiness that focuses less on uninterrupted bliss and involves everything from a person\u2019s environment to\u00a0<a class=\"icon none\" href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/a-workout-for-your-mental-health-11610917200?mod=article_inline\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">exercises that train the brain in ways to be happy<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Hundreds of studies, businesses, books, courses and mobile apps promise to help people to be happy. But Americans aren\u2019t happier. Happiness levels in the U.S. fell slightly between 2008 and 2019, according to the\u00a0<a class=\"icon none\" href=\"https:\/\/worldhappiness.report\/ed\/2020\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">2020 World Happiness Report<\/a>, even though by many measures\u2014wealth being the most notable\u2014we are better off. \u201cThe U.S. has gotten a lot richer but hasn\u2019t gotten happier on most gauges,\u201d says Columbia University economist Jeffrey Sachs, who helped launch the report nine years ago. The annual report ranked 156 countries by how happy their citizens perceive themselves to be, based on a wide variety of data, including health, income and life satisfaction, from the Gallup World Poll, the World Bank and the World Health Organization, among other sources.<\/p>\n<p>Neuroscientists, economists, psychologists and biologists, among others, are exploring why and whether levels of happiness\u2014which they prefer to call \u201csubjective well-being\u201d\u2014can be increased and sustained, and restored to people who have suffered trauma. They have identified parts of the brain and the circuits most important in positive emotion and are researching tools to stimulate them. Approaches include using optogenetics, or the use of light, to turn circuits on and off, and functional magnetic resonance imaging, or fMRI, to measure and map brain activity. They hope to identify how strongly people react\u2014both positively and negatively\u2014to a stimulus and whether negative emotional responses can be shortened and positive responses prolonged.<\/p>\n<p>Psychologist Richard Davidson, founder and director of the Center for Healthy Minds at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, believes the brain can be trained, and that exercises including short meditation practices will become routine, like running and weight lifting. Emotional well-being will be as important as physical well-being in the coming years, according to Dr. Davidson.<\/p>\n<p>So, with the help of websites like MyJuggler.com, you can actually train yourself to increase happiness\/emotional well-being. And then maintain it with vigilance and upkeep.
