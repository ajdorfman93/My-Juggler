<p>As parents, we want our kids to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/15/parenting-expert-on-how-to-raise-smart-confident-kids-by-teaching-repetition-and-ritual.html">feel good about themselves</a>, so we try to praise them as much as possible.</p>
<p>That’s not necessarily a bad thing. <a href="https://familybuildersok.org/2020/05/the-benefits-of-praising-your-children/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Research</a> shows that there are benefits to praising kids. A simple compliment can generate self-worth and pride. However, it depends on what kind of praise we give, as well as when and how frequently.</p>
<p>As a psychotherapist who works with parents and children, I’ve seen over and over again the negative effects of overpraising a child’s talent or outcome (“This looks amazing!” “You’re so handsome!” “Good job!”).</p>
<p>But these short, exaggerated reactions can cause kids to only focus on things that may harm their self-esteem. They might feel performance anxiety (“If I get this answer wrong, I am dumb”), for example, or believe that they are only appreciated for their appearance (“What if people think I look weird in this shirt? Then they won’t love me”).</p>
<p>So should you praise your kids at all? Of course. But there are right and wrong ways to give praise. Here’s what parents of confident, self-motivated and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/17/psychotherapist-parenting-tips-what-the-most-mentally-strong-kids-always-do.html">mentally strong</a> kids always do:</p>
</div>
<h2 class="ArticleBody-styles-makeit-subtitle--LnHeO">1. They praise the process</h2>
<div class="group">
<p>When you praise the process (e.g., the kid putting effort into a math assignment), instead of the talent or outcome (e.g., the kid’s natural ability to solve math problems quickly), kids are <a href="http://news.stanford.edu/news/2013/february/talking-to-baby-021213.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more likely</a> to develop a positive attitude toward future challenges.</p>
<p>In the 1990s, <a href="https://ed.stanford.edu/faculty/dweck" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Carol S. Dweck</a>, a professor of psychology at Stanford’s Graduate School of Education, studied the effects of these types of praises. In <a href="https://cpb-us-w2.wpmucdn.com/web.sas.upenn.edu/dist/b/398/files/2019/04/1998-04530-003-1sagefw.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one experiment</a>, a group of children was told they were successful because they were smart, while the second group was told they were successful because they worked hard.</p>
<p>When the two groups were given a variety of puzzles, children in the second group were more likely to choose a harder puzzle. Dweck also found that praising the process made them more likely to feel confident in a task even if they made a mistake.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="ArticleBody-styles-makeit-subtitle--LnHeO">2. They never make it a competition</h2>
<div class="group">
<p>Parents love to compare — we can’t help it! And sometimes, we’ll even tell our kids that they’re better than others (“You scored more goals than all your teammates combined!”).</p>
<p>Often, it’s done with good intentions. We want them to feel as proud as we do, and to be motivated to do even better the next time &#8230; but for all the wrong reasons.</p>
<p>It’s not healthy to be trapped in a vicious cycle of competition. Social comparisons can teach kids to always measure success based on the outcomes of other people.</p>
<p>Even worse, <a href="https://srcd.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/cdev.12936" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to research</a>, giving kids praise in terms of comparison, in some cases, can cultivate narcissism, attention-seeking behavior and a lack of teamwork values.</p>
<p>The better approach? Encourage them to compare their past efforts with their present efforts, rather than with other people. This gets them into the habit of shifting their goals away from being better than everyone else and toward self-improvement.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="ArticleBody-styles-makeit-subtitle--LnHeO">3. They use observational language</h2>
<div class="group">
<p>Instead of saying, “That’s so good!”, you may want to say, “I love the colors in your painting. Tell me more about why you chose them.” (This is what it means to praise the process.)</p>
<p>Another example: Instead of saying, “You looked like a pro riding that bike!,” parents of motivated kids might say something like, “You were so careful and focused while riding your bike. Even when you wobbled a bit and almost fell off, you kept going! That was cool to watch.”</p>
<p>These simple language tweaks can help your kids feel proud of themselves for putting effort into something. It can also make them more excited to take on more challenging things in the future.</p>
<p>Lastly, it’s important to create an environment of emotional safety. If your child failed a spelling test, refrain from telling them they should have studied harder. Instead, ask them what they think they can do to improve next time.</p>
<p>Kids need to know that they can come to their parents not just when they’ve done something well, but also when they are struggling with a specific task or challenge.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="blog-entry__subtitle--full">Being a better listener is the secret to better relationship communication.</h2>
<h3 class="blog_entry__key-points-title">KEY POINTS</h3>
<ul class="blog_entry__key-points-item-list">
<li class="blog_entry__key-points-item">People can build strong relationships by becoming better listeners and improving communication.</li>
<li class="blog_entry__key-points-item">Being a good listener involves clarifying, reflecting feelings, attending to non-verbal cues, paraphrasing, and asking open-ended questions.</li>
<li class="blog_entry__key-points-item">Conflict is inevitable, but its impact on a relationship depends on whether partners feel understood.</li>
</ul>
<p>Strong relationships require good communication. Being a better communicator may sound intimidating, but it’s really as easy a building a key skill: being a good listener.</p>
<p>It sounds simple. We (mostly) hear our partner’s questions, comments, stories, complaints, and helpful suggestions. But how often do we truly listen? Too often we’re only superficially registering that they’re talking, waiting for our chance to jump in and say what we want. That needs to change. Everyone wants to feel heard in their relationship, your partner included. For good reason too, because research shows that being a good listener is an important social skill that nurtures social connections (Gearhart &amp; Bodie, 2011).</p>
<p>Improving your listening skills starts with answering a basic question: <em>What is the simple key to improving communication with your partner?</em> The answer: <em>Give a “C.R.A.P.O.”</em></p>
<p>Yes, you have to care about what the other person is saying. But C.R.A.P.O. is also a clever acronym to help you remember the five key behaviors for being a better listener:</p>
<p><strong>1. Clarify </strong>–<strong> </strong>How often are you 100% perfectly clear about what your partner tells you? Probably not that often, or as often as you think. That’s not good enough. If your partner explains themselves, shares how they feel, or tells you something important, they deserve to be fully understood. No mistakes, fuzziness, or misinterpretations allowed.</p>
<p>To get it right you can’t rely on assumptions. To remove all doubt, just ask. Keep them talking so you can gather more information and enhance your comprehension. Along the way, your questions can also help your partner process their own thoughts and feelings. To accomplish that, we should ask things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>“What did you mean by ___?”</li>
<li>“Am I correct that ___ is the key issue?”</li>
<li>“Can you give an example of ___?”</li>
<li>“When you mentioned ___, what exactly are you saying?”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Reflect Feelings </strong>–<strong> </strong>Ok, I have to fess up. I should have named this “<a class="basics-link" title="Psychology Today looks at empathy" href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/empathy" hreflang="en">empathy</a>” but spelling out C.R.A.P.O. required an “R” so I improvised. That said, the “R” could also stand for “Really Important.” Of the five keys, reflecting feelings may be the most essential. To master empathy you need to realize that behind anything your partner communicates is an emotion they’re hoping we pick up on. Sometimes it’s super obvious (e.g., “I feel completely unappreciated around here.”). Other times it’s not clear at all, like when your partner just gives a loud sigh or says “I’m tired.”</p>
<p>When it’s ambiguous, don’t ignore it. Instead, give a C.R.A.P.O. by making an effort to figure it out. Dig in to identify deeper feelings and identify them as specifically as possible. Instead of saying “you sound mad” branch out to more nuanced feelings like hurt, frustration, annoyance, undervalued, or unfulfilled. If those sound hard to identify, they may be at first, but you’ll get better with practice.</p>
<p>It’s also ok to be wrong. Even if you’re off base, your partner sees that you’re trying, which opens the door for them to elaborate. In fact, when it comes to empathy and relationship satisfaction, research shows that effort matters more than accuracy (Venaglia &amp; Lemay, 2019). You get points for trying.</p>
<p>This is what empathy or reflecting feelings looks like:</p>
<p>Scenario: Your partner comes home and complains about their commute.</p>
<p>Bad: “Sounds awful.” Or “Yeah, commuting sucks.”</p>
<p>Better: “You must be frustrated.”</p>
<p>Best: “You work so hard, that commute must be <a class="basics-link" title="Psychology Today looks at stressful" href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/stress" hreflang="en">stressful</a> and is the last thing you needed.”</p>
<p><strong>3. Attending</strong> –<strong> </strong>Being a good listener isn’t just about what you say, but also how you look. Though you may spend more time worrying about finding the right things to say, you also need to attend to your nonverbal signals. Those involve anything you do that sends messages to your partner that go beyond the words you use. It’s everything you do to show your partner that you’re completely present and fully engaged. Doing so shows your partner that they’re important to us and helps us pay <a class="basics-link" title="Psychology Today looks at attention" href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/attention" hreflang="en">attention</a>. Here are few ways to boost <a class="basics-link" title="Psychology Today looks at nonverbals" href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/body-language" hreflang="en">nonverbals</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sit squarely facing your partner</li>
<li>Be open (e.g., no crossed arms)</li>
<li>Lean slightly toward them</li>
<li>Maintain eye contact (no staring at your phone or other screens)</li>
<li>Have a relaxed posture (not too stiff or rigid)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Paraphrasing</strong> – A big part of listening is making it clear to your partner that you “get it.” To do that, you want to recap what your partner just said to you, but in your own words. This shouldn’t devolve into a word-by-word thesaurus challenge, but should be a quick summary. That isn’t easy, but your efforts are worth it because paraphrasing shows you care and are fully invested.</p>
<p>To really capture what your partner is saying and rephrase it, you’ll need to pay really close attention and listen intently. Not coincidentally, these are two key pieces of being a good listener. Here are some suggestions to help you with paraphrasing:</p>
<ul>
<li>“You’re basically saying…”</li>
<li>“Sounds like…”</li>
<li>“Essentially…”</li>
<li>“To me, it feels like…”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5. Open-ended questions </strong>– When most people talk, you’re honestly not super interested. But your partner isn’t most people. Your partner deserves more from you. Show them that you give a C.R.A.P.O. by letting your partner have the spotlight. Not only that, do everything you can to let them talk and work through their thoughts and feelings.</p>
<p>The easiest way to do that is by asking open-ended questions that show your partner you want to hear more. But not just any questions. You’ll want to avoid simple yes/no questions, and ones that focus on who, what, when, and where facts (though getting those right is an important part of the clarify step). Instead, pose questions that require deeper analysis. Some great options are:</p>
<ul>
<li>“What led you to that decision?”</li>
<li>“How do you see this situation resolving itself?”</li>
<li>“How did you arrive at this conclusion?”</li>
<li>“What do you think led to this happening?”</li>
<li>“What was their intention?”</li>
<li>“If I was in a similar circumstance, what would you suggest I do?”</li>
</ul>
<p>Every relationship has flaws. But relationship discord doesn’t have to threaten your relationship. Rather, conflict’s impact on a relationship depends on whether partners feel understood (Gordon &amp; Chen, 2016). When someone doesn&#8217;t feel heard, conflict is harmful, but when we feel like our partner knows where we’re coming from, disharmony is less of a threat. When you use your <a class="basics-link" title="Psychology Today looks at emotional intelligence" href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/emotional-intelligence" hreflang="en">emotional intelligence</a> by taking the time to show your partner that you truly care about what they’re saying, they feel heard. Being a good listener is an important life skill both in and out of your relationship. But, when our partner “gets us” and we felt heard, communication improves and the relationship grows stronger.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 class="blog_entry__key-points-title">KEY POINTS</h3>
<ul class="blog_entry__key-points-item-list">
<li class="blog_entry__key-points-item">Attempts to make others happy increase happiness more so than trying to make oneself happy, new research suggests.</li>
<li class="blog_entry__key-points-item">The findings may seem counterintuitive, but they confirm previous research that shows that people derive happiness from helping others.</li>
<li class="blog_entry__key-points-item">Feelings of &#8220;relatedness,&#8221; or being close to others, may help explain why helping others boosts mood.</li>
</ul>
<p>Martin Luther King Jr. said the “surest way to be happy is to seek <a class="basics-link" title="Psychology Today looks at happiness" href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/happiness" hreflang="en">happiness</a> for others.”</p>
<p>New <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17439760.2021.1897867">research</a> published by a team of psychologists at the University of Missouri-Columbia suggests that King’s words are as true today as they were a half-century ago — that our own happiness is, in part, influenced by the kindness and <a class="basics-link" title="Psychology Today looks at generosity" href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/altruism" hreflang="en">generosity</a> we show others.</p>
<p>“Americans are guaranteed the right to ‘pursue happiness’ for themselves,” say the researchers, led by Liudmila Titova and Kennon Sheldon. “But might they be better off if they pursued happiness for others? We compared the two strategies, showing that, ironically, the second pursuit brings more personal happiness than the first.”</p>
<h3>Helping Others Boosts Happiness</h3>
<p>To arrive at this conclusion, the authors asked a group of research participants to engage in a series of behaviors and thought experiments that pitted acts of self-directed happiness against those aimed at improving the happiness of others. In one study, participants were approached on the street after parking their cars. They were given a few quarters by a research assistant and were asked to either feed their own parking meters or the meters of an adjacent car. The researchers then asked participants how happy they felt. Interestingly, people who fed others’ meters showed a greater boost in happiness than those who fed their own meters, despite not knowing who they were helping.</p>
<p>In another experiment, the researchers asked participants to either recall a time they tried to make someone else happy or themselves. Participants were asked to write a few sentences describing the event and rate how happy it made them feel. Again, participants who were prompted to recall a time they tried to improve the happiness of someone else reported higher levels of remembered happiness than those who wrote about a time when they tried to improve their own happiness.</p>
<p>“The results of these studies extend findings from previous research by showing that people derive boosted personal happiness from attempts to make other people happy — an approach that might seem counterintuitive for a lot of people at first,” state the researchers.</p>
<h3>Inspiring Feelings of Closeness</h3>
<p>The research squares with other studies showing how spending money on others increases one’s happiness more than spending money on oneself. But it’s not just financial generosity that has the power to increase our happiness — donating our time to someone in need, or simply adopting a mentality that puts others’ happiness above our own, has a positive impact on our psychological well-being.</p>
<p>The researchers offer a good explanation for why they saw the results they did. They suggest that it has to do with our basic psychological need for “relatedness,” or feeling close to others. According to the researchers, an attempt to make another person happy inspires feelings of closeness which, in turn, explains why people end up feeling happy themselves. The same chain of reasoning does not work when attempts at happiness or mood enhancement are self-directed.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this research adds another bullet point to a growing list of scientifically vetted techniques aimed at improving happiness. For instance, other emerging research has found that increasing our sense of <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fpspp0000225">mattering</a> and <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1948550619854751">autonomy</a>, as well as making an effort to surround ourselves with <a class="basics-link" title="Psychology Today looks at optimistic" href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/optimism" hreflang="en">optimistic</a> people (and to live in a happier society), are also viable ways to improve psychological well-being.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 class="subhead">Most hatred stems from our assumption of guilt regarding people&#8217;s thoughts and motivation.</h3>
<blockquote><p><i>Benjamin Scheibehenne from the University of Basel and his colleagues, Jutta Mata from Stanford University &amp; Peter Todd from Indiana University, suggest that even though people will claim to be pretty good at predicting the likes and dislikes of others we are often anything but good. Surprisingly, they present evidence showing that the longer we know someone, far from our predictions getting better, they may actually get worse.</i></p>
<p><i>In one set of studies, those subjects who were asked to predict the preferences of people they had known for a relatively short time were accurate 42% of the time. Surprisingly those who predicted the preferences of someone that they had known for a much longer time were accurate just 36% of the time. Perhaps the most telling result of all was how little awareness people had over how well they actually knew people. In pre-study tests, both groups estimated that their prediction accuracy would be at least 60%.</i></p>
<p>Excerpted from: Older? Yes! But Wiser? Maybe Not! &#8211; Insideinfluence.com July 5, 2011</p></blockquote>
<p>Although many may be surprised by the results of this study, my anecdotal experience as a marriage and relationship coach firmly backs them up. The biggest problem most couples have is not what they don&#8217;t know about each other, but rather what they think they do know. I&#8217;m amazed by how often my clients &#8211; some of whom have been in their relationships for decades &#8211; are convinced that they know all sorts of things about their spouse, when in fact they don&#8217;t seem to have a clue. And although their cluelessness is obvious to me (and their spouse), it&#8217;s usually not at all so for them. In fact, as the results of the abovementioned study indicate, the degree to which they are sure of what they know is often a pretty good indicator as to just how off-base they actually are.</p>
<blockquote class="pullquote"><p>We tend to forget that our experience is a product of our unique and personal perception of life.</p></blockquote>
<p>The study attempts to identify reasons why longer-term relationships might engender less knowledge and awareness &#8211; such as a decreased motivation to learn, a higher likelihood to assume knowledge, or a greater tendency amongst the &#8220;more committed&#8221; to feel the need to tell little white lies. These explanations are valid but fail to nail the essential point, which is that we tend to forget that our experience is a product of our unique and personal perception of life. As a result, we generally equate greater experience with greater knowledge, but the truth is that no matter how convinced we are about the way something looks to us, we must never assume that it looks that way to the next person. If we truly understood this, we would feel a powerful combination of humility about our own perspective, and curiosity about how the world actually looks through the eyes of others.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m struck by the kinds of things that people assume about each other. I&#8217;ve come across husbands who are convinced that their wives don&#8217;t care about their own children, and wives who believe that their husbands are only interested in working them to the bone. I&#8217;ve even had people tell me with complete wide-eyed sincerity that their friends actually derive great pleasure from being difficult and uncooperative. It&#8217;s almost as if they believe that people wake up in the morning, look in the mirror, and say to themselves, &#8220;I think I&#8217;m going to ruin somebody&#8217;s life today!&#8221; And they are often so enamored by their personal take on reality that even when their spouse or friend denies having those thoughts and motivations, they refuse to believe them.</p>
<p>The basic assumption of innocence that underpins America&#8217;s legal system often fails to extend itself to our personal relationships. Many of us are likely to fare better at the hands of an anonymous jury of our peers than at the hands of those who supposedly know us and care about us most.</p>
<p>According to our sages, the fast of Tisha B&#8217;Av is meant to wake us up to the fact that the painful lack of holiness in our world, and the more than 2,000 years of suffering that our people have experienced as a result, have all been caused by baseless hatred (<i>sinat chinam</i> in Hebrew). There is no better time than now to reflect upon the truth that most hatred stems not from people&#8217;s actions, but from our assumption of guilt regarding their thoughts and motivation. No doubt, there are people out there who are making poor choices and behaving improperly on an objective scale, but we must never forget that it&#8217;s our tendency to attribute hostile intent, and not the deeds themselves, that causes the anger, resentment, and ultimately the hatred that we feel within ourselves for our fellow human beings.</p>
<p>So next time we feel the urge to judge someone we know &#8211; be it a relative, co-worker or a friend &#8211; let&#8217;s stop and take a moment to get in touch with how frustrating it feels to be misunderstood and pigeonholed by someone else. With a modicum of humility, we just might let go of our assumptions and consider the possibility that the people in our lives are really no different than us. They&#8217;re trying to do the very best that they can, regardless of how things may appear to us.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Practicing the art and science of bonding through talking</h2>
<p>Have you ever met someone and instantly clicked?  Most of us have.  Thinking back, what created the spark?  Most likely it was a combination of topic, tone, and tenor, but it no doubt happened within a verbal exchange.  Conversation is one of the easiest ways to connect.  Although not everyone likes to talk.  Some people are <a class="inline-links topic-link" title="Psychology Today looks at shy" href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/basics/shyness">shy</a>, aloof, emotionally distant, or otherwise unapproachable.  You may have tried (unsuccessfully) for years to soften up a standoffish employee at the office, only to hit it off instantly with a stranger at the airport. Apparently, familiarity is not the deciding factor.  What is?  Research has some answers.</p>
<p><strong>Let’s Talk: Topics and Tactics</strong></p>
<p>Because chemistry is created through conversation, topics matter.  Whether you are seeking to cultivate a relationship personally or professionally, successful ice breakers are questions the other person actually wants to answer.  Thankfully, there are some tried and true safe harbors within the subject spectrum.</p>
<p>Unless there are significant privacy concerns, asking about someone’s children is a relatively safe subject that prompts people to open up — usually with great enthusiasm.  And in terms of furthering a pleasurable exchange, listening to a gushing recitation of an eldest son’s football <a class="inline-links topic-link" title="Psychology Today looks at career" href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/basics/career">career</a>, or a daughter’s promotion at work, gives you an abundance of information to follow up on.</p>
<p>But creating chemistry requires more than pleasurable topics.  Consider how much more than words are exchanged when two people are talking.  Pace, tone, <a class="inline-links topic-link" title="Psychology Today looks at body language" href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/basics/body-language">body language</a>, facial expression, and emotion.  We form interpersonal bonds and build rapport nonverbally in many different situations — with many different types of people. Research corroborates these observations.</p>
<p><strong>Chemistry Goes Beyond Content</strong></p>
<p>Namkje Koudenburg et al. (2017) studied the impact of conversational form, beyond its content, on the emergence and regulation of social structure.[i]  They recognize the importance of social interaction to the formation of social relationships and groups.  Acknowledging widespread knowledge about the importance of conversational content, they focused on how the act of conversing, regardless of the content, impacts a sense of solidarity. They note that conversation micro-characteristics such as smooth turn-taking and brief silences have the potential to significantly impact relationship regulation and a sense of solidarity. The researchers opine this result. Conversation form represents group social structure and provides a continuous assessment of group norms, hierarchy, and shared reality. But there’s more.</p>
<p><strong>On the Same Wavelength</strong></p>
<p>Koudenburg et al. cite previous research in recognizing that we validate our viewpoints by exchanging information with other people.  Yet they note that a sense of shared reality does not emerge merely through information exchange or comparing opinions, it is created through a subjective experience of smooth conversation flow—because of the visceral sensation of being on the same wavelength.</p>
<p>Accordingly, we should be more successful in connecting with others when discussing matters of mutual interest. Think this through beforehand when you are seeking to make a good impression, you no doubt have some type of interest in common with everyone.  Breaking the ice with strategically selected (safe) subjects will spark both conversation and chemistry.</p>
<p><strong>The Role of Rapport</strong></p>
<p>Other research adds an additional layer to the chemistry analysis, discussing the importance of building rapport. Zachary <a class="inline-links topic-link" title="Psychology Today looks at G" href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/basics/intelligence">G</a>. Baker et al. (2020) explain that rapport plays an important role in satisfying basic psychological needs.[ii] They describe rapport as positively linked to liking, <a class="inline-links topic-link" title="Psychology Today looks at cooperation" href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/basics/teamwork">cooperation</a>, self-disclosure, and affiliation.  In their research, Baker et al. found rapport independently predicted need satisfaction in the areas of autonomy, competence, and relatedness.</p>
<p>Also, of interest, Baker et al. found that the relationships between interaction partners did not moderate the resulting associations. This last point is of particular interest when attempting to build relationships with acquaintances or even strangers; rapport is not only possible, but also a powerful way to bond socially.</p>
<p>The bottom line appears to be that as we trial attorneys know after years of questioning witnesses, it’s not just what you say but how you say it. The same applies to sparking chemistry through conversation. Topic, tone, and tenor have the potential to become relational building blocks, allowing you to authentically connect with anyone.</p>

							<p>It’s inevitable — in any marriage or relationship, no matter how positive or healthy, you are eventually going to say something you regret. The key is to make sure that, whatever you say, you don’t regret it <i>too </i>much. There’s a difference between putting your foot in your mouth and pulling the pin on a hand-grenade that can completely blow up your relationship. This is an important distinction to understand: Happy couples fight because of course they do. But they learn what they shouldn’t say in the heat of the moment. Out of respect, they understand what lines shouldn’t be crossed.</p><p>“Over time, partners learn about what to say that is acceptable and unacceptable, as well as where the line exists between the two,” says Andrew Aaron, LICSW, a marriage counselor, sex therapist and relationship therapist. He says that successful couples draw a strong line that they refuse to cross regarding respect, and that they will not act or talk disrespectfully to each other. “But for couples who have not been able to maintain their happiness, perhaps because mutual hurtfulness has eroded their goodwill or sufficient resentment has accumulated, they act from their pain with an intent to hurt the other.”</p><p>In any relationship, there are lines drawn that should not be crossed. Those in committed, happy relationships understand this. But, as a refresher course is always helpful, we consulted with a variety of relationship experts to get a sense of the phrases that couples in happy relationships should never pull out in a marriage.</p><h2>“Grow up!”</h2><p>This is a belittling phrase, but it also operates on the assumption that you are in the right and your partner is wrong, adding an element of invalidation as well. In short, assumes that however they are feeling is childish or wrong. A big mistake. “This will weaken your partners’ self-esteem,” says Shar Fuller, Relationship Expert &amp; Co-Founder of the matchmaking service Mai Tai, “and if your ratio of positive and kind behaviors to negative interactions is out of kilter — five-to-one balance is what you’re aiming for — you won’t have a positive balance on your emotional bank account.”</p><h2>“This is your fault.”</h2><p>Whenever something goes wrong, there’s a natural instinct to try and figure out what happened and why. This tends to lead to the assignation of blame, and most people’s first instinct is not to point the finger at themselves. However, if you start laying it all at your partner’s feet, then all you are doing is fostering resentment and anger. “Accusatory language makes us emotive and the logical explanation that you’re seeking will not suffice,” says Fuller. “Avoid shifting blame or making conclusions based on your limited experience to prevent a buildup of resentment.”</p><h2>“You’re pathetic.”</h2><p>Phrases like this tend to come out of a buildup of pain and bitterness that has accumulated over time. If you do not address the root of these emotions, they will come out in these contemptuous attacks. “Unresolved, pain will run the relationship and these phrases are simply symptoms of internalized pain and anger,” says Aaron. “For some partners of troubled relationships, what they say may be a carry-over from the culture of their family of origin or injuries caused in prior relationships. The internalized pain of partners has not always been accumulated from within the present relationship.”</p><h2>“I never should have married you.”</h2><p>This is the kind of statement that can ruin a relationship in an instant. The suggestion that there is, or was, a better option out there will throw your partner into self-doubt and deeply wound their sense of character and self esteem. This is a tough one to come back from, so think about what might make you say something like this and deal with it before those words ever come out. “The statement has so much depth and if you haven’t discussed the underlying issues that made you even think, it means that you might be ignoring or rationalising red flags in the relationship,” says Fuller. “If there aren’t unresolvable issues in your relationship never say this because it hurts and it’s tough to repair the type of emotional pain that it causes.”</p><h2>“You’re a loser, but you are <em>my</em> loser.”</h2><p>If this phrase, or any other such sarcastic volley, comes to mind, pause a second and examine it. Maybe your relationship is one where sarcasm is a second language. But how is this in any way a positive? Even if you think the second part of the phrase is endearing, all your partner will hear is “You’re a loser.” This isn’t a playful dig; it’s a hurtful, character-assassinating remark that has its roots in resentment. “Sarcasm is a manner of speaking in which anger-based expressions are veiled with humor,” Aaron explains, “so that the recipient has difficulty ascertaining the true intentions of the speaker and therefore less confident in a defensive reaction.”</p><h2>“I wish I never listened to you.”</h2><p>Everyone makes mistakes. Everyone makes poor choices. But it’s important not to castigate your partner when a decision leads to an unfortunate outcome. At the end of the day, you both made the decision jointly, even if your partner may have persuaded you. By saying this, you are invalidating them and making them feel worthless and as though their thoughts and ideas are not worth considering. “We all want to know that every single part of us including our ideas are loved and valued,” says Fuller. “This is another character assassination which seems harmless but actually end up making your partner defensive and less open to discussing new ideas and opportunities.”</p><h2>“You’re just like your mother or father.”</h2><p>This one is doubly insulting because it not only degrades your partner, but it also takes a swing at a close relative. It’s a low blow to dig into the character or negative attributes of someone’s family and weaponize those attributes against your partner. Getting to know your partner’s family means you’ve been welcomed into his or her circle. “Don’t abuse the trust that you’ve built up,” says Fuller. Show your partner that you respect them and their family by removing this from your vocab.</p><h2>“If you don’t do X,Y, Z it’s over.”</h2><p>Ultimatums do not work in a relationship ever, especially when they come packaged with threats of abandonment. Throwing around threats like this make it look like your feelings for your partner are either disposable or not real at all. If your spouse feels like they’re one mistake or one refusal to comply away from losing you, how can they feel secure in the relationship? “This sort of comment can have a lasting effect on your relationship because even if you don’t finish it you’ve already implied that they are not important in your life anymore,” Fuller says. “This weakens the long-term emotional bond and is a minus two for that emotional bank account each time you say it. I hope you get the picture because it’s pretty bleak.”</p><h2>“I’m sorry that I’m not good enough for you”</h2><p>Confidence is key in a relationship, and this display of a lack of confidence will lead to frustration. It also suggests an inflexibility or an unwillingness to change. “This is how I am, so if that’s not good enough for you, then I can’t help you.” From a place like that, there is almost nowhere to go. “This sort of an argument is the low part of the emotional rollercoaster that you’re both on,” Fuller says, “and the request for a sympathy vote will just dissipate because your partner may think that you’ve got a lot of self-development to do but seem unwilling to start. It doesn’t work because it’s not a constructive argument and there is little opportunity for building a stronger relationship.”</p>						</div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Why do some relationships look so promising, yet dissolve over time? And why do others, whose partners seem hopelessly mismatched, grow stronger? Much research has tried to identify the individual characteristics that make for a successful relationship, including how couples deal with conflict or communicate. All shed some light on what may underlie relationship success. But a <a class="ext" href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ai-analysed-over-11-000-couples-relationships-this-is-what-it-found" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new study of over 11,000 couples</a> reveals a key ingredient that’s easily overlooked or ignored — and it’s the major predictor of relationship <a class="inline-links topic-link" title="Psychology Today looks at happiness" href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/basics/happiness">happiness</a>, romantic <a class="inline-links topic-link" title="Psychology Today looks at intimacy" href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/basics/relationships">intimacy</a>, and connection.</p>
<p>It’s not how well two prospective partners matched up on a <a class="inline-links topic-link" title="Psychology Today looks at dating" href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/basics/mating">dating</a> site. It’s not about <a class="inline-links topic-link" title="Psychology Today looks at personality" href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/basics/personality">personality</a> features, personal history, or interests. These do play a role in predicting long-term relationship success, but the study found they play a much smaller role than one might think.</p>
<h2><strong>What’s the “Secret?”   </strong></h2>
<p>Simply put, the research found that strongest predictor is the kind of relationship the partners create together, over time. That is, the <em>quality</em> of the relationship they experience transcends individual traits or characteristics in predicting the couple’s happiness over time.</p>
<p>The <a class="ext" href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ai-analysed-over-11-000-couples-relationships-this-is-what-it-found" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">study, from Canada’s Western University,</a> was based on a different kind of analysis of information from 43 studies of the 11,000 couples. As lead author <a class="ext" href="https://www.inverse.com/mind-body/dating-study-predicts-happy-relationships" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Samantha Joel stated,</a> “It suggests that the person we choose is not nearly as important as the relationship we build.” It&#8217;s the overall way the partners relate to each other. The research shows, she adds, that &#8220;the dynamic that you build with someone — the shared norms, the in-jokes, the shared experiences — is so much more than the separate individuals who make up that relationship.&#8221;</p>
<p>The study looked at individual characteristics that you might assume to be the most important predictors of a happy relationship, like the individual partner’s feelings about their life situation, their tendency toward <a class="inline-links topic-link" title="Psychology Today looks at anxiety" href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/basics/anxiety">anxiety</a> or <a class="inline-links topic-link" title="Psychology Today looks at depression" href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/basics/depression">depression</a>, their <a class="inline-links topic-link" title="Psychology Today looks at attachment" href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/basics/attachment">attachment</a> pattern, or whether their parents had a stable <a class="inline-links topic-link" title="Psychology Today looks at marriage" href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/basics/marriage">marriage</a> or <a class="inline-links topic-link" title="Psychology Today looks at divorce" href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/basics/divorce">divorce</a>. Those factors can have a negative impact on the relationship, of course. But the research found that they were much less significant for happiness than the actual pattern of the ongoing relationship — that is, how they interact, and how each feels about the interaction. The pleasure and enjoyment of just being together.</p>
<p>That core feature includes, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>A mutual sense of strong commitment to each other; and responsiveness to each other’s needs: “I know he/she has my back.”</li>
<li>A mutual level of enjoyment with their <a class="inline-links topic-link" title="Psychology Today looks at sex" href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/basics/sex">sex</a> life.</li>
<li>A sense that their partner was happy with their relationship, and an infrequent, low level of conflict with each other.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of those findings from the empirical study match what we see clinically, as well, among couples that develop long-term, sustained pleasure in their relationships. The study was published in <a class="ext" href="https://www.pnas.org/content/117/32/19061" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>PNAS, the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.</em></a></p>
<h2>How Couples Build It</h2>
<p>What the research can’t show, of course, is how such couples “grow” that kind bond of connection, trust, and pleasure. Here, both empirical and clinical research point to some of what they do to create a positive dynamic.</p>
<p>Overall, the most encompassing is their commitment to ongoing <a class="inline-links topic-link" title="Psychology Today looks at openness" href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/basics/openness">openness</a> and exposure to each other – mutually revealing their hopes, fears, desires, and sense of where they want to go — as two separate individuals joined together in this journey through life. <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/the-new-resilience/201208/is-radical-transparency-the-key-relationship-success?collection=1071101">I described here</a> how couples do that through a practice of “Radical Transparency.&#8221;</p>
<p>There is some corroborating evidence from empirical research. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>A willingness to forgo personal interests and knowing when to put your partner&#8217;s needs ahead of your own. Letting go of self-interest in this way is directly linked to a long-lasting, happy relationship. Staying entrenched in your own ego won&#8217;t do it, as I <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/the-new-resilience/201104/why-relationship-advice-fails-improve-your-relationship">wrote about here</a>, and is reflected in research by <a class="inline-links topic-link" title="Psychology Today looks at John Gottman" href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/therapy-types/the-gottman-method">John Gottman</a> and others.</li>
<li>Feeling appreciated and valued by your partner. That tends to strengthen your marriage or committed relationship, and it increases your belief about how enduring your relationship will be over time. This was found in a <a href="http://https//www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/the-new-resilience/201511/does-showing-gratitude-have-any-impact-your-relationship">University of Georgia study that I wrote about here. </a></li>
<li>A different study I cited in <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/the-new-resilience/201804/how-make-love-first-sight-last">this post, conducted at Wake Forest University,</a> found that your relationship is strengthened when your <a class="inline-links topic-link" title="Psychology Today looks at stressed-out" href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/basics/stress">stressed-out</a> partner feels really understood and listened to. It occurs not just through words of support, but through multiple forms of conveying <a class="inline-links topic-link" title="Psychology Today looks at empathy" href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/basics/empathy">empathy</a> — eye contact, listening, and generally conveying understanding and caring, nonverbally. The key is tuning in to what your partner perceives as helpful. Inquire about that if you’re not sure — and don’t assume that you know.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, knowing the key to couples&#8217; happiness and enjoyment with each other over the long term is one thing, That&#8217;s the science part. Really practicing it? That&#8217;s the art of the relationship.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="subhead">Four helpful dating strategies.</h2>
<hr />
<div class="article-body">
<p>It’s Tu B&#8217;Av, the Jewish day of love. And for some the day carries with it yet-to-be-fulfilled dreams and desires. So, for those of us (and we’ll focus more on the women here, keeping in mind that most of this can be applied to the men as well) who are still looking for that special someone with whom we’d like to share the journey of life, here are four strategies to consider if you’d like to be checking a different box in the marital status section of the government forms you fill out this time next year&#8230;</p>
<h2 class="article-subheader">1. Stop trying to be married by this time next year.</h2>
<p>When you go into a date feeling pressure for this to be “the one”, you unconsciously (or consciously) try to force a result onto a process rather than allowing it to grow organically, enjoyably, and taking things as they come.</p>
<p>This doesn’t mean not to be marriage-minded when <a href="https://www.aish.com/d/">dating</a>. But there is a big difference between “I would really like to get married sometime soon” and “It has to be this one because if it’s not with him, it might never happen.”</p>
<p>Turning a desire into an obligation you bestow upon the next guy who sits across from you isn’t going to bode well for the two of you tying the knot in the near future.</p>
<p>The opportunity of the moment is passing you by because you’re busy trying to dictate its outcome. Being stuck in the future causes you to miss out on the present.</p>
<p>This fear can sabotage courtship. Instead, recognize that you’re not in control of what others feel. And do the only thing you can do: Remain authentic to who you are, enjoy the moment, have fun, and&#8230;</p>
<h2 class="article-subheader">2. Stop questioning if he likes you. Ask yourself if you like him.</h2>
<p>Don’t twist yourself into a pretzel to get someone’s approval. Instead of giving real responses, your fear of being rejected leads you to be something that you’re not in an attempt to control what the guy thinks of you in order to win him over.</p>
<p>All that mental string pulling can be exhausting and give your brain the mental equivalent of a serious case of arthritis.</p>
<p>So stop looking at your interactions from his perspective. That’s his job and he’s got that covered. Your job is to drop into <i>your</i> perspective and view your interactions with <a href="https://www.aish.com/d/w/557748091.html">your date</a> from there.</p>
<p>Stick to these three simple questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Do I like him?</li>
<li>Does he treat me well?</li>
<li>Do I want to see him again?</li>
</ol>
<p>Instead of worrying about what he&#8217;s thinking about you, ask yourself what you think about him. Instead of getting ahead of yourself and entangled in a web of finality and pressure around whether or not you can spend the rest of your life with this person, stay in the present and simply ask yourself if you&#8217;d like to see him again.</p>
<p>Is the answer yes? Then great. On to another date with this guy.</p>
<p>Keep this attitude as you continue to date him. It will keep you grounded, true to yourself, in the moment&#8230; and you&#8217;ll see where it goes.</p>
<h2 class="article-subheader">3. Become emotionally whole.</h2>
<p>We need the right amount of good quality food to be functioning at our peak physical state. Without that, we&#8217;re off our game, become irritable, get impatient and snap at people.</p>
<p>We also have emotional needs that need to be satiated. When we ignore our emotional needs, we find ourselves rattled and out of sync with the person we want to be, unable to employ the traits we want to exude.</p>
<p>Sometimes the solution to running on emotional empty is simply to identify the activities that fill you up and energize you and incorporate them into your life. It can be reading a book in the park, curling up on the couch with a hot drink, getting back into yoga, spending time on the beach, or meeting up with a friend that gives off positive energy.</p>
<p>Whatever the nourishing self-care activities are for you, find them and plug them into your daily, weekly and monthly routine so that you’re emotionally satiated and the best version of yourself.</p>
<p>When you enjoy the various aspects of your life, it leads you to a sense of fullness, contentment and confidence. It brings out the best of you and sends out signals that are attractive, endearing, and awakens the desire in others to want to make a place for you in their life.</p>
<h2 class="article-subheader">4. Fitness matters.</h2>
<p>Hand-in-hand with becoming that best version of yourself emotionally, is becoming the best version of yourself physically. When you’re physically striving, you feel better about yourself and come off more radiant.</p>
<p>So, make fitness a priority in your life. Establish goals and meet them. And we are not talking here about walking twenty minutes a day. Carve out time to do something intense and truly difference-making on an ongoing basis.</p>
<p>Doing a workout regimen will make you feel more powerful and confident in an array of other areas of your life because a change anywhere is a change everywhere.</p>
<p>As you step up your game and treat yourself better, your standards in all areas of life are likely to go up – and that’s going to come across in how you present yourself and interact.</p>
<p>If you want to be married this time next year, let go of whatever is beyond your control and do all that’s in your power to live your life to its fullest and healthiest. Stay in the moment. Stay in touch with yourself. Stay connected with your desires – and let all other pressures and voices fall by the wayside.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Too much going on, but feeling like you never have enough. Overscheduled. Overworked. Overwhelmed. Overstressed.</p>
<div class="group">
<p>While this past year has only made emotional exhaustion even more acute, burnout was already a crisis long before the pandemic. That’s why, early last year, when I started brainstorming ideas for my <a href="http://www.hbomax.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HBO Max</a> <a href="https://play.hbomax.com/series/urn:hbo:series:GXyGa5Q0Nm8PCKAEAAAL7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">docuseries about happiness</a>, I knew I had to do an episode on work-life balance.</p>
<p>There I was on the other side of 40 — a new husband, a new dad, and realizing I didn’t really have space for these new roles in my life. In fact, when I became a father, I figured I should probably work even more to support my family. That turned out to be a bad move.</p>
<p>I was in Montreal filming a movie at the time, working on my eight other projects whenever I wasn’t on set. It basically rendered my wife a single mom. We were both burned out, and the little time we had together was spent fighting about things that the other person wasn’t doing.</p>
<p>One day, I woke up and just started typing my emotions into a Google Doc. stream of consciousness stream. So many words. <em>Oooh, now I’m saying all these things I didn’t even know I was feeling!</em></p>
</div>
<div class="Pullquote-styles-makeit-container--2Q8qH" data-test="Pullquote">
<div class="Pullquote-styles-makeit-pullquoteFadedIn--3A-XS Pullquote-styles-makeit-pullquote--1iI8t Pullquote-styles-makeit-pullquoteBase--1Ad43">
<div class="Pullquote-styles-makeit-wrapper--5MFTP">
<div class="Pullquote-styles-makeit-quote--KeAk_"><em><strong>At the very top, in all-caps, were the words: “I AM SO UNHAPPY.”</strong></em></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="group">
<p>But the best part of that journal entry was the first sentence. It was something I had never said to myself — the kind of statement I was immune to because I always believed in being “strong” and “optimistic” no matter what, even though I was actually miserable. There it was, at the very top, in all-caps, those words: “I AM SO UNHAPPY.”</p>
<p>I guess you could call that my “Jerry McGuire” moment. Breakdown. Breakthrough.</p>
<p>The next day, I called my therapist, Janice. I told her how I felt overwhelmed. I love working, and I love creating new projects, and now more than ever, I felt like I needed to earn more money. But I also wanted to find a way to be home more, to spend time with my wife and daughter. I wanted to have fun again. At some point, adulthood had become a burden.</p>
<p>About a month later, one of my best friends, Matt Pohlson, came over for dinner. I told him what I was going through, and he confided in me. “Dude, me too,” he said. While Matt’s circumstances were different, we realized that we both were at our low points. We had invested all of our self-esteem into work.</p>
<p>That’s when things became clear: The mountain that we keep trying to climb every day might never actually reach a peak. We were tired as hell and feeling like there was no end in sight. I would later discover that we were suffering from something called “workaholism.” Most of our friends have it (and you probably do, too).</p>
</div>
<div class="Pullquote-styles-makeit-container--2Q8qH" data-test="Pullquote">
<div class="Pullquote-styles-makeit-pullquoteFadedIn--3A-XS Pullquote-styles-makeit-pullquote--1iI8t Pullquote-styles-makeit-pullquoteBase--1Ad43">
<div class="Pullquote-styles-makeit-wrapper--5MFTP">
<blockquote>
<div class="Pullquote-styles-makeit-quote--KeAk_">Attending your own funeral is life-affirming. You realize what really matters. You picture the people who will miss you the most. You see how they were affected.</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="group">
<p>I asked Matt to join me on a trip for my docuseries, to South Korea, a country that was also <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Economy/South-Korea-tackles-workaholic-culture-with-new-labor-law" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">experiencing a work-life balance crisis</a>. What was once one of the poorest countries shifted into overdrive to become one of the <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/koreas-path-from-poverty-to-philanthropy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">greatest economic comebacks of the last 50 years</a>. But the downside? Workaholism and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/04/asia/korea-working-hours-intl/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">staggering levels of depression and suicide</a>.</p>
<p>In Seoul, there’s even a bridge that’s affectionately referred to as the “Death Bridge.” To address the issue of high suicide, the government put up <a href="https://www.pri.org/stories/2012-09-27/bridge-signs-used-south-korea-anti-suicide-efforts" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">positive, uplifting statements along the guardrails</a>, hoping to change to someone’s mind: “How are you doing?” “Tomorrow’s sun will rise.” “Go see the ones you miss.” “How would you like to be remembered as a father?” Beneath the statements are pictures of delicious meals. The logic is that great food make us happy and reminds us of our family.</p>
<p>But the most innovative approach we saw was a concept called the “death cafe.” It’s pretty simple — you pay to act out your own funeral.</p>
<p>When Matt and I arrived at the cafe, we received a form to write our own eulogies. There was a waiting room of other people in line to “fake die.” Someone came by and took our pictures to put over the caskets.</p>
<p>Then, a guy dressed as the grim reaper appeared (that’s not an exaggeration — he wore all black and a tall, pointy hat). “If you only had six months left, would you live your life the same way you did yesterday?” he asked, while walking us to our caskets. We climbed inside. The doors closed. Silence. And there I was, in complete darkness.</p>
<p>A bell rang after 10 minutes, and we all sat up. One by one, we read our eulogies out loud:</p>
<p><em>“Mom, dad, Geeta, Mahaley, Amelie, Everyone &#8230; I once read a Buddhist philosopher who said, the measure of one’s happiness in life is the extent to which, by the time he’s passed, he’s contributed to evolution. I hope your lives are better as a result of having me. I know mine was better because of you. I had so much fun. Laughing. Loving. Crying. God, I’m just so lucky. I love you all so much. I’ll miss you &#8230; but maybe not, because dead people don’t have feelings. Bye, Rav.”</em></p>
<p>We laughed. We cried. It was a life-changing journey — and probably my favorite scene in the series. I want you to experience it for yourself, so I’d rather not give too much of it away.</p>
<p>But I will tell you this: Attending your own funeral is life-affirming. It changes your perspective on happiness. You realize what really matters. You picture the people who will miss you the most. You see how they were affected. Why they were affected. Work doesn’t come up at all. All people remember is how you made them feel.</p>
<p>Perhaps our funeral is the culmination of the work that really matters.</p>
<p>In a sense, the way you live your life can be, in effect, a true reflection of the eulogy that’s perfect for you — so perfect, in fact, that you couldn’t have written it any better yourself.</p>
