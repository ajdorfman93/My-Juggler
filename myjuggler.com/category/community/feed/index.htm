<ul class="blog_entry__key-points-item-list">
<li class="blog_entry__key-points-item">Attempts to make others happy increase happiness more so than trying to make oneself happy, new research suggests.</li>
<li class="blog_entry__key-points-item">The findings may seem counterintuitive, but they confirm previous research that shows that people derive happiness from helping others.</li>
<li class="blog_entry__key-points-item">Feelings of &#8220;relatedness,&#8221; or being close to others, may help explain why helping others boosts mood.</li>
</ul>
<p>Martin Luther King Jr. said the “surest way to be happy is to seek <a class="basics-link" title="Psychology Today looks at happiness" href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/happiness" hreflang="en">happiness</a> for others.”</p>
<p>New <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17439760.2021.1897867">research</a> published by a team of psychologists at the University of Missouri-Columbia suggests that King’s words are as true today as they were a half-century ago — that our own happiness is, in part, influenced by the kindness and <a class="basics-link" title="Psychology Today looks at generosity" href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/altruism" hreflang="en">generosity</a> we show others.</p>
<p>“Americans are guaranteed the right to ‘pursue happiness’ for themselves,” say the researchers, led by Liudmila Titova and Kennon Sheldon. “But might they be better off if they pursued happiness for others? We compared the two strategies, showing that, ironically, the second pursuit brings more personal happiness than the first.”</p>
<h3>Helping Others Boosts Happiness</h3>
<p>To arrive at this conclusion, the authors asked a group of research participants to engage in a series of behaviors and thought experiments that pitted acts of self-directed happiness against those aimed at improving the happiness of others. In one study, participants were approached on the street after parking their cars. They were given a few quarters by a research assistant and were asked to either feed their own parking meters or the meters of an adjacent car. The researchers then asked participants how happy they felt. Interestingly, people who fed others’ meters showed a greater boost in happiness than those who fed their own meters, despite not knowing who they were helping.</p>
<p>In another experiment, the researchers asked participants to either recall a time they tried to make someone else happy or themselves. Participants were asked to write a few sentences describing the event and rate how happy it made them feel. Again, participants who were prompted to recall a time they tried to improve the happiness of someone else reported higher levels of remembered happiness than those who wrote about a time when they tried to improve their own happiness.</p>
<p>“The results of these studies extend findings from previous research by showing that people derive boosted personal happiness from attempts to make other people happy — an approach that might seem counterintuitive for a lot of people at first,” state the researchers.</p>
<h3>Inspiring Feelings of Closeness</h3>
<p>The research squares with other studies showing how spending money on others increases one’s happiness more than spending money on oneself. But it’s not just financial generosity that has the power to increase our happiness — donating our time to someone in need, or simply adopting a mentality that puts others’ happiness above our own, has a positive impact on our psychological well-being.</p>
<p>The researchers offer a good explanation for why they saw the results they did. They suggest that it has to do with our basic psychological need for “relatedness,” or feeling close to others. According to the researchers, an attempt to make another person happy inspires feelings of closeness which, in turn, explains why people end up feeling happy themselves. The same chain of reasoning does not work when attempts at happiness or mood enhancement are self-directed.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this research adds another bullet point to a growing list of scientifically vetted techniques aimed at improving happiness. For instance, other emerging research has found that increasing our sense of <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fpspp0000225">mattering</a> and <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1948550619854751">autonomy</a>, as well as making an effort to surround ourselves with <a class="basics-link" title="Psychology Today looks at optimistic" href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/optimism" hreflang="en">optimistic</a> people (and to live in a happier society), are also viable ways to improve psychological well-being.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>As the COVID-19 pandemic forced many to reconsider what makes them happy, researchers began embracing a more complex definition of the emotion that focuses less on uninterrupted bliss&#8230;</em></p>
<p><strong>Laurie Santos is the professor behind &#8216;Psychology and the Good Life,&#8217; the most popular course in Yale&#8217;s history. Here, she discusses how we need to reconsider our approach to mental health to cater for the complex emotions triggered by the pandemic.</strong></p>
<div class="wsj-snippet-body">
<p>Think you know what it means to be happy? Think again.</p>
<p>Scientists are learning how to better measure and improve happiness, as the pandemic forces many <a class="icon none" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/amid-life-in-lockdown-theres-joy-in-having-the-family-together-11586484300?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to question what brings them joy</a>. In the future, some experts believe, people will embrace a more complex definition of happiness that focuses less on uninterrupted bliss and involves everything from a person’s environment to <a class="icon none" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-workout-for-your-mental-health-11610917200?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exercises that train the brain in ways to be happy</a>.</p>
<p>Hundreds of studies, businesses, books, courses and mobile apps promise to help people to be happy. But Americans aren’t happier. Happiness levels in the U.S. fell slightly between 2008 and 2019, according to the <a class="icon none" href="https://worldhappiness.report/ed/2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2020 World Happiness Report</a>, even though by many measures—wealth being the most notable—we are better off. “The U.S. has gotten a lot richer but hasn’t gotten happier on most gauges,” says Columbia University economist Jeffrey Sachs, who helped launch the report nine years ago. The annual report ranked 156 countries by how happy their citizens perceive themselves to be, based on a wide variety of data, including health, income and life satisfaction, from the Gallup World Poll, the World Bank and the World Health Organization, among other sources.</p>
<p>Neuroscientists, economists, psychologists and biologists, among others, are exploring why and whether levels of happiness—which they prefer to call “subjective well-being”—can be increased and sustained, and restored to people who have suffered trauma. They have identified parts of the brain and the circuits most important in positive emotion and are researching tools to stimulate them. Approaches include using optogenetics, or the use of light, to turn circuits on and off, and functional magnetic resonance imaging, or fMRI, to measure and map brain activity. They hope to identify how strongly people react—both positively and negatively—to a stimulus and whether negative emotional responses can be shortened and positive responses prolonged.</p>
<p>Psychologist Richard Davidson, founder and director of the Center for Healthy Minds at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, believes the brain can be trained, and that exercises including short meditation practices will become routine, like running and weight lifting. Emotional well-being will be as important as physical well-being in the coming years, according to Dr. Davidson.</p>
<p>So, with the help of websites like MyJuggler.com, you can actually train yourself to increase happiness/emotional well-being. And then maintain it with vigilance and upkeep. Enjoy!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As a professor of psychology at Yale and host of The Happiness Lab podcast, I&#8217;ve spent the last few years teaching simple science-backed tips to improve our well-being. I know the research inside out—but the giant dumpster fire of a year that was 2020 has had me struggling, too.</p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has cheated us out of all the good times we live for—the weddings, the vacations, the graduations and celebrations. Our work lives have been upended and our livelihoods threatened. There are people we love who we haven&#8217;t seen in months and some we&#8217;ll never see again; millions of us are mourning someone close who&#8217;s been taken by this awful disease. These overwhelming losses have had a devastating effect on our mental health, with rates of depression, anxiety and even suicidality surging around the world.</p>
<p>The good news is that there&#8217;s a lot to be hopeful for in the new year. With a vaccine on the way, there&#8217;s a real hope that we&#8217;ll soon be returning to the way of life we miss so much. But we can&#8217;t toss out our masks just yet. Even under the best public health scenarios, we&#8217;re in for several more months of cancelled plans, social distancing, and skyrocketing COVID cases, all during the coldest and darkest times of the year. For a while at least, 2021 is going to feel like 2020 2.0.</p>
<p>So how do we get it through it? Most of us realize that we need to take steps to manage our stress and emotions during tough times. The problem is we tend to go about managing those feelings in surprisingly ineffective ways. If you listen to my podcast, The Happiness Lab, you&#8217;ll know this is a common refrain. Our minds have really bad intuition about what we should do to become hap- pier and feel better. So even when we put in some work to improve our well-being, we often wind up doing it wrong.</p>
<p>But there is a better, scientific approach to improving our own happiness. Over the last two decades, psychologists have studied the kinds of behaviors and mindsets that really can boost well-being.</p>
<p>I started gathering these scientific findings together long before anyone had heard of COVID-19. It was back in 2018 when I had just come face-to-face with a different mental health crisis: the one facing my students at Yale. I had just taken on a new role as a Head of College, which meant living with students on campus and seeing their daily lives up close. I witnessed the high rates of stress and anxiety my students were facing first hand. Too many of the young people I cared about were lonely, stressed about the future and intensely worried about their grades. But it wasn&#8217;t just Yale students who were struggling. A 2018 survey of college students nationally reported that more than 40 percent were so depressed it was difficult to function, more than 60 percent had experienced overwhelming anxiety, and more than one in 10 had seriously considered suicide in the previous year.</p>
<p>Faced with these awful statistics, I wanted to do something to help. I decided to create a new class on the science of happiness—one that gave students practical, evidence-based tips for reducing their stress and improving their well-being. And the students showed up in droves. Over a thousand students attended class the first week. We had to move to a concert hall. In the end, it became the largest class in Yale&#8217;s history with just under a quarter of the entire student body registered. The popularity of the class prompted Yale to share the happiness class more broadly. We put a six week version of the course—called The Science of Well-Being—on Coursera.org so that anyone in the world could take it for free. Hundreds of thousands of people signed up.</p>
<p>But that was all before COVID hit. Starting in March of 2020, en- rollment in my online happiness class doubled, tripled—then octupled. In the middle of a pandemic, more than three million people signed up to take an Ivy League class about how to feel happier.</p>
<p>But did it work? Could taking a scientific approach to happiness help people feel better in the midst of a deadly pandemic?</p>
<p>My team and I are still compiling the results formally, which requires months of careful data analysis and review. But I had a chance to see for myself the powerful impact the class was having on my learners&#8217; well-being. The evidence, it turns out, was there in my university mailbox.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your mailbox is overflowing.&#8221; So began the terse email I received from our psychology department administrative assistant. &#8220;And there is more mail on the counter, too. Please stop by some point.&#8221; With so many COVID restrictions on campus, I had neglected to pick up my office mail for a few months. I expected to be greeted by the normal stack of flyers and junk mail. Instead I found letter after letter from people writing to thank me. I saw just how powerful the lessons I was teaching could be.</p>
<p>Through happy tears, I read literally hundreds of stories of my students using what I taught them to make it through the anxiety and frustration of the pandemic dark times. But one story in particular struck me, from Susan, an 81-year old retired social studies teacher. Susan had spent most of 2019 nursing her beloved hus- band before he died that Christmas Eve. They&#8217;d been in love since seventh grade. &#8220;He was the kindest, sweetest and—I think—most handsome man,&#8221; she wrote. Susan was devastated by her loss, and thought things couldn&#8217;t possibly get worse. And then COVID hit.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your psychology of happiness was a godsend.&#8221; Susan decided to put the evidence-based tips I taught in class into practice in her daily life. Did these new practices fully eradicate the pain of her loss? Of course not. But when 2020 plunged Susan into the darkest time of her life, the five main takeaways of my class really helped. By incorporating these tips into her life, she said, she wound up significantly happier than she otherwise would have been. And that&#8217;s the message I heard over and over again from all those let- ters: scientific research gives us a set of small practices that we can use to make things a little better. And these days, a little bit of happiness counts for a lot.</p>
<p>So what are these five practices I share with my students? Here are the key ideas that worked for Susan and—as you&#8217;ll see from the evidence below—are backed up by science.</p>
<h3>Get Social</h3>
<p>One of the many cruelties of coViD-19 is that it has robbed us of one of the primary behaviors we can engage in to improve our happiness: being with other people.</p>
<p>When psychologists Ed Diener and Marty Seligman looked at people who scored in the highest 10th percentile on happiness surveys, they discovered that there was one activity that set happy people apart from the rest of us—happy people were more social. The results were so strong that these researchers deemed being around other people as a necessary condition for very high happiness.</p>
<p>We think that solitude feels good, especially when we&#8217;re having a tough time, but in truth being with other people will almost always make us feel better. Even if those people are strangers.</p>
