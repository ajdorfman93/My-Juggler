<h2 class="sub-head">Time, like money, can be allocated to build wealth, meaning and happiness in the years to come</h2>
<p>When it comes to time, we are born rich and then spend down our fortunes over the years. It may not grow like <a class="icon none" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/six-ways-to-protect-your-money-in-2023-11671791429?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" rel="noopener">money in a bank account</a>, but there are ways to get time to pay out a similar kind of interest.</p>
<p>The go-to verb for what we do with time is “spend” it. Researchers say it might be better <a class="icon none" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/invest-in-yourself-the-way-youd-invest-in-the-stock-market-in-2023-11672089635?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to think of time as something we invest</a>, using our precious hours to accumulate a wealth of fulfillment and meaning that our future selves can draw on.</p>
<div class="paywall">
<p>This shift in thinking is particularly important because it might help us think longer term. Recent research by Hal Hershfield and Cassie Holmes, both professors at UCLA’s Anderson School of Management, and their collaborators indicates that those who think about their time over longer horizons—say, years or a lifetime—tend to be happier day-to-day and more satisfied with their life.</p>
</div>
<p>“If we start thinking about investments of time, rather than expenditures, maybe we’ll start focusing on allocating time toward the things that are more closely linked to our longer-term well-being,” Prof. Hershfield says.</p>
<p>He is currently investigating whether cuing people to think about “investing” their time, versus “spending” it, might prod them into that longer-term mind-set and affect what they choose to devote their time to.</p>
<p>Our anxieties about misusing our limited time have deep roots. Among the earliest written uses of the verb “spend” with “time” is from a 14th-century poem, according to Kory Stamper, a lexicographer. The regret-tinged line, originally composed in Middle English, roughly translates to “The lifetime that I’ve been lent / in idleness I have spent.”</p>
<p><a class="icon none" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/heres-what-a-1-million-retirement-looks-like-in-america-11671890735?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" rel="noopener">When we invest money</a>, we tie up our present resources in exchange for future gains. But investments of time have the advantage of paying out in both present enjoyment and far-off benefits, says Prof. Holmes.</p>
<p>For someone creating a temporal portfolio, an important task is to figure out which activities <a class="icon none" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-to-make-education-an-investment-after-college-11672405830?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">deliver the best return on investment</a>. Studies have found that some reliably gratifying ways to use your time include deepening social connections, exercising and getting absorbed in meaningful work, says Prof. Holmes.</p>
<p>Prof. Holmes recommends determining your own best investments by performing an audit of your time use for a week or two. This exercise, which Prof. Holmes details in her book <a class="icon none" href="https://www.cassiemholmes.com/happierhour" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">“Happier Hour,”</a> consists of recording, in half-hour increments, what you did and how happy you felt while doing it on a scale of 1 to 10.</p>
<p>When Prof. Holmes has her business-school students conduct a self-audit, some of them are surprised to find that they spend more than a dozen hours a week on social media.</p>
<p>“When they look at how they feel having spent time scrolling, they see, ‘Holy cow, on a 10-point scale, it’s like a four,’” Prof. Holmes says. “Meanwhile, going out to dinner with their sister or friend or partner is like a nine, but often, it’s like, ‘I don’t have time to meet up with my friends for dinner because I’m so busy.’ ”</p>
<p>Having a time-investing mind-set means being proactive, Prof. Holmes says. It means committing in advance to rewarding activities rather than attempting to squeeze those things in only after doing whatever seems most urgent at the moment.</p>
<p>A proactive move she recommends is to block off time on your calendar for the investments that are important to you, just as you would a business meeting. In her own life, these high-priority weekly events are a couple morning runs, a date night with her husband, and going to a coffee shop with her daughter (who is 7, and orders hot chocolate).</p>
<p>Prof. Holmes maintains that even highly time-crunched people can benefit from an investing mind-set, because the value of small time commitments can compound. The recurring coffee date with her daughter, for example, is only 30 minutes a week, she says, “but the impact of that 30 minutes on not only my relationship with her, but on my satisfaction with my life overall, is profound.”</p>
<p>When choosing between different ways you could allocate your time, it can also help to imagine what your future self might hope you chose.</p>
<p>“Who am I, what am I going to be doing in five years, 10 years?” asks Prof. Hershfield. “When we look back, we don’t want to regret finding that our time slipped through our fingers, being spent on stuff that turned out to not be all that meaningful.”</p>
</div>
<p>Prof. Hershfield is the author of the forthcoming book <a class="icon none" href="https://www.amazon.com/Your-Future-Self-Tomorrow-Better/dp/0316421251" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">“Your Future Self,”</a> and writing it led him to take the perspective of his own future self more often. Recently, when he had a few open days on his calendar, he was torn between focusing on an important work project and taking time off to visit his 99-year-old grandmother with his 3-year-old son.</p>
<p>Looking at the situation through the eyes of his future self made the decision to spend time with family an easy one. “It’s not clear to me that in 10 years, I’ll even remember what progress I would have made on whatever project it was,” he says.</p>
<p>Even a year or two of imagined hindsight can help, according to Anat Keinan, a marketing professor at Boston University’s Questrom School of Business.</p>
<p>Prof. Keinan has <a class="icon none" href="https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article-abstract/33/2/273/1849580" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">conducted surveys</a> of college students after they returned from winter break, asking them if they wished they had spent more time working and studying, or more time traveling and enjoying themselves. The group that was asked about their latest winter break was more likely to regret not doing more of the former, more productive activities. Meanwhile, the group that was asked about their winter break a year prior was more likely to regret not doing more of the latter, more meaningful and fun activities.</p>
<p>One force that can stop people from doing things their future selves would appreciate, Prof. Keinan has found, is guilt about not doing something productive.</p>
<p>“It’s not idle time,” Prof. Keinan says. “It’s actually a great investment in your future memories.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Maybe it&#8217;s time to step back and change what is really running your life.</h3>
<h3 class="blog_entry__key-points-title">KEY POINTS</h3>
<ul class="blog_entry__key-points-item-list">
<li class="blog_entry__key-points-item">Some drivers in our lives are destructive or keep us from reaching our potential.</li>
<li class="blog_entry__key-points-item">We can think of common drivers likes steps on a ladder from most negative to most positive.</li>
<li class="blog_entry__key-points-item">By acknowledging your drivers, you have the opportunity to focus on and change them.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you step back and look at the landscape of your life, what’s drives you? What shapes what you do, not in terms of priorities—the things you focus on—but the engine that pushes your life along?</p>
<p>Seeing our lives as being driven is not new to psychology. <a class="basics-link" title="Psychology Today looks at Freud" href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/freudian-psychology" hreflang="en">Freud</a> mapped out his 5 stages of development: oral, anal, phallic, genital, that not only propel a child&#8217;s development but can shape the adult&#8217;s.<sup>1</sup> And Maslow became famous for his Hierarchy of Needs, which moves up from the biological to self-actualizing.<sup>2</sup> As these authors point out, there are good and bad drivers, but each sets the pace, the tone of your life. You can choose what drives you, but the challenge is that you don’t choose. Instead, you accept what you get, or get used to, and call it life. You can change that, but first, you need to know where you stand.</p>
<p>Here are some of the most common drivers, ranked from those with the most significant positive impact (passions) to those providing the most negative impact (addictions). The line separates what we might consider adverse mental health from the positive.</p>
<p><strong>Passions / Purpose</strong></p>
<p><strong><a class="basics-link" title="Psychology Today looks at Goals" href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/motivation" hreflang="en">Goals</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Routines</strong></p>
<p><strong>______________</strong></p>
<p><strong>Emotionally Driven / Shoulds / Self-Criticism</strong></p>
<p><strong><a class="basics-link" title="Psychology Today looks at Anxiety" href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/anxiety" hreflang="en">Anxiety</a> / <a class="basics-link" title="Psychology Today looks at Depression" href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/depression" hreflang="en">Depression</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Addictions</strong></p>
<p>Here’s how they break down:</p>
<h3><strong>Addictions</strong></h3>
<p>Here we think of <a class="basics-link" title="Psychology Today looks at alcoholism" href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/alcohol" hreflang="en">alcoholism</a>, drugs, <a class="basics-link" title="Psychology Today looks at sex" href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/sex" hreflang="en">sex</a>, workaholism. What makes them addictive is that they kidnap your brain. Rational thinking goes offline, your midbrain pleasure center takes over and you just do what you do because you do it. You’re the passenger, and your <a class="basics-link" title="Psychology Today looks at addiction" href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/addiction" hreflang="en">addiction</a> is running your life.</p>
<h3><strong>Anxiety / Depression</strong></h3>
<p>Unfortunately, this is the driver for too many of us. According to the Anxiety &amp; Depression Association of America, anxiety is the number one mental health problem in the U.S. affecting 18 percent of the population.<sup>3</sup> It can take many forms—panic attacks, <a class="basics-link" title="Psychology Today looks at obsessive-compulsive" href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/ocd" hreflang="en">obsessive-compulsive</a> disorder, generalized anxiety, phobias. But regardless of the form, the impact is the same—your life is derailed. You worry, you avoid, you feel compelled to do things that you know are irrational, occupying too much of your time and mind.</p>
<p>Depression is the cousin of anxiety. Often, they go hand-in-hand. Worry leads to feeling overwhelmed, which can lead to feeling stuck or trapped, leading to feeling hopeless. When one or both of these take over, you are either always thinking about the what-ifs of the future or regretful and trapped by the past. The present dissolves into a blur.</p>
<h3><strong>Emotionally Driven / Shoulds / Self-criticism</strong></h3>
<p>While these are not formally diagnosable conditions, each has a negative impact on your life. Folks who are emotionally driven tend to run their lives based on how they feel. If they “feel” like cleaning up the house, they do; if they don’t, they don’t. While there’s an apparent spontaneity in their lives, they also struggle with the discipline needed to get things done that are difficult or necessary. They miss deadlines, problems get swept under the rug, they can seem to be unreliable to others.</p>
<p>Those driven by too many shoulds can go too far in the other direction. Rules run their lives. They can seem rigid with their black and white thinking and may feel guilty for breaking the rules. Because the rules are usually inherited from others, running your life this way often keeps you out of touch with your deeper needs and wants.</p>
<p>Finally, self-criticism is the <a class="basics-link" title="Psychology Today looks at bully" href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/bullying" hreflang="en">bully</a> who beats you up when you break the rules. Rather than enjoying your life, you spend much of your time trying to stay out of trouble with yourself.</p>
<h3><strong>Routines</strong></h3>
<p>Routines are useful. Without them, our anxiety goes up and we are essentially forced to invent each day from scratch. But if your days become too routinized, we’re running on autopilot; there’s too little spontaneity, few opportunities for joy. Life is safe but bland.</p>
<h3><strong>Goals</strong></h3>
<p>Setting goals and working towards them are good antidotes to routine’s downsides. You are proactive rather than reactive, creative rather than staid. But you can undermine your goals if you are emotionally driven. When the going gets tough and the goals are not your own, you lose enthusiasm, or your expectations are unrealistic. When that happens, it’s easy for anxiety, self-criticism, and depression to take over.</p>
<h3><strong>Passions/Purpose</strong></h3>
<p>Passion and purpose are at the top of our ladder because they arise from that core of who we are and want to be and carry none of the baggage of the others. When driven by passion and purpose, we are honest with ourselves and others. There is a natural integrity as our inner and outer lives reflect each other. We have the discipline to do what we want and need to do, yet can change our minds and be spontaneous without <a class="basics-link" title="Psychology Today looks at guilt" href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/guilt" hreflang="en">guilt</a> or self-criticism.</p>
<p>So, when you step back and look at your life, what are your drivers? What keeps you from moving up that ladder? What do you need to do to reach greater fulfillment? How can you start today?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>New research in psychology sheds light on the factors that shape our happiness.</h2>
<p>We spend a large portion of our lives searching for things that make us happy.</p>
<p>What works? That depends, but psychologists and <a class="inline-links topic-link" title="Psychology Today looks at happiness" href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/happiness">happiness</a> researchers have identified a few common elements that tend to be found in happy people. Here are three recent findings from the field of happiness science that may help guide you to a brighter, happier future.</p>
<p><strong>Pillar #1: Be autonomous.</strong></p>
<p>Money can&#8217;t buy happiness. But research generally shows a positive association between income and happiness.</p>
<p>What might we learn from high wealth individuals about how to optimize our own happiness? One insight comes from <a class="ext" href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1948550619854751" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">research</a> exploring the way wealthy people choose to work and spend their time.</p>
<p>Scientists at Maastricht University, Harvard Business School, and Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam surveyed 863 high net worth individuals and 1,232 non-high net worth individuals, looking for similarities and differences in the way the wealthy spent their time, and how this influenced their happiness.</p>
<p>They found fewer differences between the wealthy and non-wealthy than they expected. For instance, both groups spent approximately the same amount of time engaging in leisure activities, working and commuting, and using their phone and computer.</p>
<p>There was one key difference that emerged, however. The scientists found that millionaires were more likely to spend time on work activities that offered more personal autonomy—that is, work they decided to do themselves instead of following the guidance of others. This was shown to relate to higher life satisfaction.</p>
<p>Another interesting finding was that millionaires tended to spend more time engaging in &#8220;active&#8221; leisure pursuits (for example, praying, socializing, exercising, and volunteering) while non-millionaires engaged in more passive leisure activities (watching TV, napping and resting, and doing nothing).</p>
<p><strong>Pillar #2: Tune into your “sense of mattering.”</strong></p>
<p>Happiness comes in two forms. There is in-the-moment happiness, which is derived from things that give us immediate pleasure, like eating a chocolate bar or taking a hot shower on a cold day. There’s also the related idea of life meaning, fulfillment, or reflective happiness. We experience this type of happiness when we reach a milestone or create something we are proud of. It may not be as state-altering as in-the-moment happiness, but its effects can be just as potent, especially in the long run.</p>
<p>While both types of happiness are important, the science suggests that life meaning becomes more important to us over time. Fortunately, a recent <a class="ext" href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fpspp0000225" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">paper</a> published in the <em>Journal of <a class="inline-links topic-link" title="Psychology Today looks at Personality" href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/personality">Personality</a> and Social Psychology</em> offers guidance on how to improve it.</p>
<p>“Meaning is the web of connections, understandings, and interpretations that help us comprehend our experience and formulate plans directing our energies to the achievement of our desired future,” state the researchers, led by Vlad Costin of the University of Sussex. “Meaning provides us with the sense that our lives matter, that they make sense, and that they are more than the sum of our seconds, days, and years.”</p>
<p>From this definition, the researchers extracted three core themes: coherence, purpose, and mattering.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Coherence</strong> refers to the process of making sense of the world and one’s experiences in it. Feeling a “sense of order” and “comprehensibility” are key facets of life coherence.</li>
<li><strong>Purpose</strong> describes the feeling of having a life goal, or multiple life <a class="inline-links topic-link" title="Psychology Today looks at goals" href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/motivation">goals</a>, and working towards those goals. It is understood as a future-oriented motivational state and involves having a vision for how one&#8217;s future should be.</li>
<li><strong>Mattering</strong> refers to the belief that one’s actions are making a difference in the world and that one’s life is significant and worth living.</li>
</ul>
<p>The scientists tested which of these three factors might be most predictive of life meaning. Using a sample of 126 British adults, they found that mattering was most strongly associated with life meaning. Purpose was also predictive of life meaning but to a lesser extent. Coherence, on the other hand, appeared to be more of a consequence of life meaning than a cause.</p>
<p>How should we go about improving our sense of mattering? While there’s no easy answer, a good place to start is by thinking about the questions that define the concept of mattering. They are: “my life is inherently valuable,” “even a thousand years from now, it would still matter whether I existed or not,” “whether my life ever existed matters even in the grand scheme of the universe,” and “I am certain that my life is of importance.”</p>
<p>Other <a class="ext" href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17439760.2019.1689416?journalCode=rpos20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">research</a> suggests that mattering is especially important in our professional lives. Employees who scored higher on the agree-disagree scale below, for instance, expressed higher job satisfaction and engagement.</p>
<ol>
<li>My work contributes to my organization’s success.</li>
<li>The quality of my work makes a real impact on my organization.</li>
<li>My work influences my organization’s functioning.</li>
<li>My organization praises my work publicly.</li>
<li>My co-workers praise my work.</li>
<li>I am well known for the quality of my work in my organization.</li>
<li>My work has made me popular in my workplace.</li>
</ol>
<p>“When employees feel like they matter to their organization, they are more satisfied with their jobs and life, more likely to occupy <a class="inline-links topic-link" title="Psychology Today looks at leadership" href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/leadership">leadership</a> positions, more likely to be rewarded and promoted, and less likely to quit,” state the authors of this research, led by Andrew Reece of the company, BetterUp, and David Yaden of the University of Pennsylvania. “These findings lend weight to the basic value of mattering in organizational contexts.”</p>
<p><strong>Pillar #3: When it comes to happiness, age is on your side.</strong></p>
<p>Youth, they say, is wasted on the young. Fortunately, the same cannot be said about happiness.</p>
<p>Most research suggests that happiness, well-being, and life satisfaction increase gradually from early adulthood to middle age. And, a recent <a class="ext" href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1948550619832023" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">study</a> published in the journal <em>Social Psychology and Personality Science</em> echoes this finding with respect to optimism.</p>
<p>To arrive at this conclusion, researchers at the University of California, Davis, analyzed data from a large sample of U.S. adults between the ages of 26 and 71. At four time points across a seven-year period, participants were asked to complete the Life Orientation Test, a widely used and validated measure of optimism. A modified version of the Life Orientation Test is shown below.</p>
<ol>
<li>In uncertain times, I usually expect the best.</li>
<li>If something can go wrong for me, it probably won’t.</li>
<li>I&#8217;m always <a class="inline-links topic-link" title="Psychology Today looks at optimistic" href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/optimism">optimistic</a> about my future.</li>
<li>I mostly expect things to go my way.</li>
<li>I often count on good things happening to me.</li>
<li>Overall, I expect more good things to happen to me than bad.</li>
</ol>
<p>The researchers used people&#8217;s responses from this scale to plot the trajectory of optimism across the lifespan. Consistent with prior work, they found optimism to be lowest in people’s 20s, then rise steadily into people’s 30s and 40s, peaking in people’s 50s, and gradually declining after that. Specifically, it was at age 55 that people experienced the highest levels of optimism.</p>
<p>“We found that the trajectory of optimism from ages 26 to 71 was characterized by normative age-graded increases, at a rate of about .15 standard deviations per decade, before plateauing around age 55,” state the researchers. “Together, these findings suggest that the development of optimism across the adult lifespan follows an inverted U shape, with a peak in late <a class="inline-links topic-link" title="Psychology Today looks at midlife" href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/mid-life">midlife</a>, similar to other positive personality traits such as <a class="inline-links topic-link" title="Psychology Today looks at self-esteem" href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/self-esteem">self-esteem</a> and satisfaction with life.”</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>: New psychological research suggests that autonomy, mattering, and age are three important components of happiness. While the age component will take care of itself, it’s up to you to guide your life in a direction that will enhance your sense of mattering and autonomy.</p>

Someone can be demanding, independent, vain or risk-taking.</p><p> </p><p>Which traits are most likely to be found in psychologically “healthy” individuals? A team of researchers led by Weibke Bleidorn of the University of California, Davis attempted to answer this question in a <a class="ext" href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2019-00289-001" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new paper</a> published in the <em>Journal of Personality and Social Psychology</em>. They found that high levels of <a class="inline-links topic-link" title="Psychology Today looks at openness" href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/basics/openness">openness</a> to feelings, positive emotions, and straightforwardness, combined with low levels of <a class="inline-links topic-link" title="Psychology Today looks at neuroticism" href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/basics/neuroticism">neuroticism</a>, were most indicative of a healthy personality.</p><p> </p><p>“Scholars have been interested in characterizing a healthy personality prototype since the beginning of the scientific study of personality,” states Bleidorn and her team. “The father of modern personality trait theory, Gordon Allport, distinguished the ‘mature person’ based on their intentional pursuit of long-term <a class="inline-links topic-link" title="Psychology Today looks at goals" href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/basics/motivation">goals</a>. [&#8230;] Erik Erikson famously claimed that Sigmund <a class="inline-links topic-link" title="Psychology Today looks at Freud" href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/basics/freudian-psychology">Freud</a> described the healthy person as someone who can love and work.”</p><p> </p><p>Bleidorn and her team added a contemporary twist to this age-old question. In their first study, they recruited 137 personality experts to rate which of 30 commonly-used personality traits would appear in psychologically stable individuals. They found that experts rated openness to feelings, warmth, positivity, and straightforwardness as the traits most likely to appear in well-adjusted individuals. Hostility, depressiveness, vulnerability, and anxiousness, on the other hand, were rated as least likely to be found in well-adjusted individuals.</p><p> </p><p>Below is the full list of personality traits, ranked high to low on their likelihood of describing a psychologically “healthy” individual:</p><p> </p><ol><li>Openness to Feelings</li><li>Warmth</li><li>Positive Emotions</li><li>Straightforwardness</li><li>Competence</li><li><a class="inline-links topic-link" title="Psychology Today looks at Altruism" href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/basics/altruism">Altruism</a></li><li>Activity</li><li>Openness to Values</li><li>Tender-Mindedness</li><li>Dutifulness</li><li>Gregariousness</li><li>Self-Discipline</li><li>Order</li><li>Achievement</li><li>Deliberation</li><li>Openness to Aesthetics</li><li><a class="inline-links topic-link" title="Psychology Today looks at Assertiveness" href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/basics/assertiveness">Assertiveness</a></li><li>Trust</li><li>Compliance</li><li>Openness to Ideas</li><li>Modesty</li><li>Openness to <a class="inline-links topic-link" title="Psychology Today looks at Fantasy" href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/basics/fantasies">Fantasy</a></li><li><a class="inline-links topic-link" title="Psychology Today looks at Excitement-Seeking" href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/basics/sensation-seeking">Excitement-Seeking</a></li><li>Openness to Actions</li><li>Self-consciousness</li><li>Impulsivity</li><li>Anxiousness</li><li>Vulnerability</li><li>Depressiveness</li><li>Hostility</li></ol><p>Next, the researchers repeated this exercise with a group of undergraduate students. They found a high degree of consistency between the ratings of the personality experts and the undergraduates, suggesting that the personality traits associated with psychological health can be identified by laypeople and experts alike.</p><p> </p><p>The researchers then put their profile of the psychologically “healthy” individual to the test. They did this by measuring how well their “healthy” profile lined up with other psychological dimensions such as well-being, <a class="inline-links topic-link" title="Psychology Today looks at self-esteem" href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/basics/self-esteem">self-esteem</a>, <a class="inline-links topic-link" title="Psychology Today looks at aggression" href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/basics/anger">aggression</a>, and <a class="inline-links topic-link" title="Psychology Today looks at narcissism" href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/basics/narcissism">narcissism</a>. Examining survey responses from over 3,000 individuals, they found support for their predictions: Psychologically healthy individuals scored higher on psychological dimensions associated with superior psychological functioning (e.<a class="inline-links topic-link" title="Psychology Today looks at g" href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/basics/intelligence">g</a>., self-esteem, <a class="inline-links topic-link" title="Psychology Today looks at self-concept" href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/basics/identity">self-concept</a> clarity, and <a class="inline-links topic-link" title="Psychology Today looks at optimism" href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/basics/optimism">optimism</a>) and lower on dimensions associated with psychological dysfunction (e.g., exploitativeness, aggression, and antisocial behavior).</p><p> </p><p>The authors conclude, “Similar to <a class="inline-links topic-link" title="Psychology Today looks at Carl Rogers" href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/therapy-types/person-centered-therapy">Carl Rogers</a>’ portrayal of the ‘fully functioning’ person, the psychologically healthy person can be characterized as being capable to experience and express emotions, straightforward, warm, friendly, genuine, confident in their own abilities, emotionally stable, and fairly <a class="inline-links topic-link" title="Psychology Today looks at resilient" href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/basics/resilience">resilient</a> to <a class="inline-links topic-link" title="Psychology Today looks at stress" href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/basics/stress">stress</a>.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="blog_entry--full__subtitle">Changing our definition of average and how this benefits us in the long run</h2>
<p>In the <a class="inline-links topic-link" title="Psychology Today looks at career" href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/basics/career">career</a> world, resumés are the yardstick with which we measure our progress. This metric is one of the few ways we can quantitatively size up our successes, and there’s something about having that standardized measurement of accomplishment that intimidates even the most exceptional overachiever.</p>
<p>It’s like a mirror that seems to add 20 pounds to your figure. Seeing every accomplishment, every job, all of the internships and volunteer work that you’ve ever had summed up into 12-point Times New Roman text that doesn’t even take up an entire page is discouraging, to say the least. Pondering your newfound inadequacy, you ask yourself, <em>is this all I am? Am I really this average?</em></p>
<p>Yes. You really are that average. And that’s OK.</p>
<p><strong>The Role of Social Media Plays in Feeling Subpar</strong></p>
<p>It seems we have created a distorted view of being average, and consequently, we try to avoid it at all costs. A <a class="ext" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5479883/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">study done on averageness and how we perceive it</a> shows just how skewed our perspective is on the notion. Participants overall tended to label their own abilities as above average—try drawing <em>that</em> bell curve out—but the study also found evidence that people consider “average” as being synonymous with having below-average abilities rather than interpreting the term as its <a class="ext" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/average" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">literal definition.</a></p>
<p>It’s a sign of the times, and it’s also <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/basics/social-comparison-theory">social comparison </a>at work. With every scroll through social media, every new LinkedIn connection, we are reminded not of our own accomplishments, but the accomplishments of others (read: things you didn’t accomplish but somebody else did). Meanwhile, other social media platforms like Instagram or Facebook remind us of the cars we don&#8217;t drive and the places we haven&#8217;t been. The age of technology has opened our eyes to the lives we don’t have, and all of the sudden, each of ours seems lackluster in comparison. It’s like how every novel on the shelf at the bookstore is somehow a <em>New York Times</em> bestseller. <em>How is that even possible?</em> you ask yourself. But then you look down at the book you picked and see that it is the only one in the store without that shining medallion on the cover. Oh, and it’s also a collection of amateur poetry. A lot of times, we make ourselves feel like our life is that single, unlauded book on the shelf.</p>
<p>As the usage of platforms like LinkedIn <a class="ext" href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/273505/global-linkedin-age-group/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">continues to increase</a>, we may increasingly feel subpar in relation to our peers. <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/basics/imposter-syndrome">Imposter syndrome</a> is a feeling that many people face within competitive environments, but even our social media has become a place of comparison that we now carry everywhere.</p>
<p>Young adults in the United States who are currently entering the job market find ourselves searching for a way to cope with achievement culture being at an <a class="ext" href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2017-57603-001" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">all-time high.</a> Told from infancy that we are unique, exceptional, and capable of doing whatever we set our minds to, we have reached territory where these affirmations no longer necessarily apply. The departure from <a class="inline-links topic-link" title="Psychology Today looks at adolescence" href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/basics/adolescence">adolescence</a> has been difficult for every previous generation and will always continue to be so, but equipped with a new, digital metric for success, Generation Z must learn to adapt to its modern world and newfound adulthood.</p>
<p><strong>Our Very Own Treadmill</strong></p>
<p>The coping mechanisms of overachievers often involve, in this situation, taking on far too many responsibilities, roles, and emotional investments to carry, in hopes of overcoming the feeling of inadequacy. And for a little while, it works. The <a class="inline-links topic-link" title="Psychology Today looks at fear" href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/basics/fear">fear</a> of the average leaves us alone. But then, we decide to add one more thing to the pile and everything goes south. It’s as if we each are sprinting on our very own treadmills, and we bump up the speed every so often because it seems possible to go a <em>little</em> bit faster. And the whole time we are running on this treadmill, this monster called averageness is chasing you, until you’re sprinting so hard you can’t keep up and fly off of the back of the treadmill. Still nursing your wounds, you climb back on the treadmill, turn the speed down a notch, and go back to sprinting away from this monster that forever nips at your heels.</p>
<p>We romanticize this mad, stupid sprint. Like martyrs, we sacrifice ourselves to this futile cause of making ourselves superhuman. Everyone <a class="inline-links topic-link" title="Psychology Today looks at dreams" href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/basics/dreaming">dreams</a> of being that person who does it all—balancing a career, a family, and a <a class="inline-links topic-link" title="Psychology Today looks at social life" href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/basics/social-life">social life</a> like it’s fine china, all while using the newest iPhone without a case on it and casually wafting an oh-so-abundant resumé in your direction. And so, we run.</p>
<p>It’s time to hit the brakes on our sprint and slow down. Far too often, we try to outpace our averageness, but switching our version of success from quantitative to qualitative is what will help us realize that being average is, in the end, a great life to live.</p>
<p>Often, when you look for something you’ve lost, you never find it; it’s when you stop looking that it reappears. If all we seek is high achievements or being the best, we will only find disappointment. Not only that, but we can no longer give our entire abilities to tasks at hand if there are too many to balance. In the end, we are not necessarily any less average than we were before balancing all of these responsibilities; we may simply be average at more things.</p>
<p>Slowing down and no longer buying into the quantitative mindset of success will allow us to pour our energy and time into what we prioritize, and we will be all the better because of it. Resumés and social media can capture breadth, but they often fail to capture depth. Yet depth is really where averageness is surpassed.</p>
<p>Surrendering to an average existence could be, paradoxically, how we find our better and happier selves. <a class="ext" href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1069072717751441" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Studies suggest</a> it&#8217;s not simply the case that success leads to <a class="inline-links topic-link" title="Psychology Today looks at happiness" href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/basics/happiness">happiness</a>; happiness itself may lead to greater success. So maybe, it’s time we reprioritize what’s worth sprinting for.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="blog_entry--full__subtitle">The powerful, calming question you may be forgetting to ask yourself.</h2>
<p>Anxiety is driven by the reacting part of our brains. When you sense something that seems threatening, your body releases cortisol, the stress <a class="inline-links topic-link" title="Psychology Today looks at hormone" href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/hormones">hormone</a> that springs your body into action. This is called the stress response. For our ancient ancestors, this meant being on the ready to fight, take flight, or freeze (play dead) when facing scary threats, such as a fearsome saber-tooth tiger.</p>
<p>While in modern life you thankfully don’t meet any saber-toothed tigers, everyday challenges can still make you feel very <a class="inline-links topic-link" title="Psychology Today looks at anxious" href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/anxiety">anxious</a>—thanks to your old-school reacting brain. Usually two words driven by our anxious minds—What If?—lead the charge.</p>
<p>Examples of &#8220;What If&#8217;s&#8221; in modern-day life include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Work demands: </strong><em>&#8220;This new boss is so demanding and seems impossible to please! What if I lose my job?&#8221;</em></li>
<li><strong>Time constraints: </strong><em>&#8220;What if I can&#8217;t supervise my son&#8217;s virtual schooling (or get him to in-person school) and be at work on time?&#8221;</em></li>
<li><strong>Relationship pressures: </strong><em>&#8220;He is so nice but what if he dumps me?&#8221;</em></li>
<li><strong>Societal pressures:</strong><em> &#8220;I am so scared about these tumultuous times we live in! What if this country falls apart?&#8221;</em></li>
<li><strong>Information overload: </strong><em>&#8220;Shoot, I thought I saw your text, I meant to respond, so sorry this slipped through! What if things like this keep falling through the cracks?&#8221;</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Your Reacting Brain Can Be Tamed by Your Thinking Brain</strong></p>
<p>Fortunately, there&#8217;s another part of your brain, called the prefrontal cortex: the “thinking” part. The main job of the prefrontal cortex is to provide logical thinking to help control your emotional responses to stress so that you don’t get too <a class="inline-links topic-link" title="Psychology Today looks at stressed" href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/stress">stressed</a> out and overreact. If you place your finger on your forehead, you’ll be about as close as you can get to touching your prefrontal cortex.</p>
<p>Your prefrontal cortex can rein in your stress response, slowing down the release of cortisol—if it determines that whatever your amygdala is freaking out about is not in fact a threat, or if it recognizes that the situation is manageable. This logical thinking part of your brain is very important for helping you manage anxiety and not overreact. This helps you make good choices. And as you’ll see, often when you feel stressed out, you have to consciously remember to turn to your thinking brain to gain back control from your reacting brain.</p>
<p><strong>The 7-Word Question That Comes to the Rescue</strong></p>
<p>Realizing how “What-ifs” can really get your mind racing, you can use the power of &#8220;What is the worst thing that can happen?&#8221;  to slow them down. The following sanity-saving activity is from my latest book, <a class="ext" href="http://www.amazon.com/Anxiety-Depression-Anger-Toolbox-Teens/dp/1683732715" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Anxiety, Depression, and Anger Toolbox for Teens</em></a>, but it is applicable for all ages:</p>
<p>Close your eyes and reflect on the “what-ifs” that you have struggled with in the past and those that still come into your mind. Fill in the “what-ifs” blanks below. As you do so, reflect on each “What-if,&#8221; and think about how it gets in your way. Now think in earnest about this commonly undervalued, seven-word question, which is your antidote to stress and anxiety: &#8220;What &#8216;s the worst thing that can happen?&#8221;</p>
<p>Here’s an example to help you get started:</p>
<p><em>What if I lose my job while trying to take care of my kids during this pandemic?</em></p>
<p>&#8220;T<em>he worst thing that could happen is I will have to look for another job, which may be more suited to balancing the current demands in my life. And even if it ends up taking me longer than I&#8217;d like to get a new job, it helps to remind myself about those times in the past when I have discovered ways to cope in really hard times. Actually, now thinking about this all more reasonably, I think I am going to proactively speak to my supervisor and see if there is something we can work out to make this current situation more manageable for me.</em>&#8220;</p>
<p>Now, fill in the blanks below and give the power of this seven-word question a try for some of the stressors you would like to manage better:</p>
<p>What if ____________________________________________________________________?</p>
<p>The worst thing that could happen is  _____________________________________________ __________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>What if ____________________________________________________________________?</p>
<p>The worst thing that could happen is  _____________________________________________ __________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>What if ____________________________________________________________________?</p>
<div class="markup-replacement-slot markup-replacement-slot-8" data-slot-position="8"></div>
<p>The worst thing that could happen is  _____________________________________________ __________________________________________________________________________</p>

<div class="ModernArticleBody__cleanBodyText__sNffF article-body">
<div class="standardText">
<p>Over 20 years ago, at a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MHIcabnjrA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lecture</a> he gave at the University of Florida&#8217;s school of business, an MBA student asked <a href="https://www.inc.com/marcel-schwantes/warren-buffett-says-3-decisions-in-life-separate-high-achievers-from-mere-dreamers.html">Warren Buffett</a> a question: &#8220;What would you do to live a happier life &#8212; if you could live all over again?&#8221;</p>
</div>
<div class="standardText">
<p><a href="https://www.inc.com/marcel-schwantes/warren-buffett-says-this-is-how-you-can-instantly-spot-a-great-leader.html">Buffett</a> encouraged students to think about happiness from a more practical standpoint: None of us can live life all over again, but we can increase our overall happiness by choosing to make changes in our career, goals, finances, health, and relationships.</p>
</div>
<div class="standardText">
<p>&#8220;The way to do it is to play out the game and do something you enjoy all your life,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Be associated with people you like. I only work with people I like. If I could make $100 million with a guy who causes my stomach to churn, I&#8217;d say no.&#8221;</p>
</div>
<div class="standardText">
<p>He continued: &#8220;I urge you to work in jobs you love. You&#8217;re out of your mind if you keep taking jobs that you don&#8217;t like because you think it&#8217;ll look good on your résumé.&#8221;</p>
</div>
<div class="standardText">
<p>Do what you love. It sounds easy when you&#8217;re a billionaire many times over, but quite truthfully, Buffett was already doing what he loves long before he became successful.</p>
</div>
<div class="standardText">
<p>There are plenty of good reasons why you should heed Buffett&#8217;s advice and do what you love, including:</p>
</div>
<div class="standardText">
<h2>1. More opportunities</h2>
</div>
<div class="standardText">
<p>People who do what they love are more open to opportunities and new experiences; they are willing to accept challenges and take risks, and when they fail, they are much more resilient and able to bounce back up when getting knocked down.</p>
</div>
<div class="standardText">
<h2>2. More alignment with the things you care about</h2>
</div>
<div class="standardText">
<p>When you do what you love, you create alignment between your work, values, and the things that bring you passion and purpose. This opens up new possibilities as you learn what matters most for your life and business.</p>
</div>
<div class="standardText">
<h2>3. More motivation, which leads to your success</h2>
</div>
<div class="standardText">
<p>Loving what you do makes you more motivated to put in more time to get work done &#8212; the kind of work you <em>want</em> to do, not feel obligated to do. Your desire to be more productive is intrinsic; it comes from a belief deep inside you that your hard efforts will make a difference for those you serve.</p>
</div>
<div class="standardText lastItem">
<p>In conclusion, when you love what you do, it just doesn&#8217;t feel like work! Doing what you love is a major contributor to true happiness in life. So if you don&#8217;t know what your passion is, it&#8217;s time to figure that out.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many people would like to know themselves better, perhaps so they can make wiser moves. My clients have found the following 12 questions helpful. For each, ask yourself, “Are there any implications for what you want to do now?”</p>
<p>Let’s start directly: <em>What has a person(s) said is special about you?</em></p>
<p><em>What do people misunderstand about you?</em></p>
<p>List your life’s memorable moments, from early <a class="inline-links topic-link" title="Psychology Today looks at childhood" href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/basics/child-development">childhood</a> through today.  <em>What was an especially happy, sad, contented, and angry moment?</em></p>
<p><em>What’s something audacious that you’ve done?</em></p>
<p><em>When were you quite reticent?</em>  Usually, people wish they had been less reticent, but sometimes restraint is wise.</p>
<p><em>Who have you gotten along best with?</em> Choose a person(s) who you very much enjoy or enjoyed interacting with and a person who very much enjoy or enjoyed interacting with you.</p>
<p><em>What are your life’s best and worst serendipitous events?</em> Sometimes those apparently serendipitous events weren’t random and could offer lessons for today.</p>
<p><em>When have you been most generous with your time or money?</em></p>
<p>Imagine that the people who know you best were asked anonymously, &#8220;What makes (insert your name) special?&#8221;<em> What would be the most common answer(s)?</em></p>
<p>If you had 30 seconds to say whatever you&#8217;d like on a broadcast heard around the world, <em>what would be your main point or two? </em>Would you say something different if your face and voice were disguised?</p>
<p><em>If you didn’t care what anyone thought, what would you do?</em></p>
<p><strong>The takeaway</strong></p>
<p>Care to answer one or more of the above?  Or just in reading them, has anything come clear about what makes you special, and even what you’d like to do as a result?</p>
<p><em><a class="ext" href="https://youtu.be/JlLLPP_ldq8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I read this aloud </a><a class="ext" href="https://youtu.be/JlLLPP_ldq8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on YouTube.</a></em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="Component-root-0-2-61 Component-p-0-2-52">Mental health therapists’ caseloads are bulging. Waiting lists for appointments are growing. And anxiety and depression are rising among Americans amid the coronavirus crisis, research suggests.</p>
<p class="Component-root-0-2-61 Component-p-0-2-52">In the latest study to suggest an uptick, half of U.S. adults surveyed reported at least some signs of depression, such as hopelessness, feeling like a failure or getting little pleasure from doing things. That’s double the rate from a different survey two years ago, Boston University researchers said in the medical journal JAMA Network Open.</p>
<p class="Component-root-0-2-61 Component-p-0-2-52">The study did not ask about any diagnosis they might have received, and for many people, the problem is mostly angst rather than full-blown psychiatric illness. But experts say the feeling is genuine and deserving of professional help.</p>
<p class="Component-root-0-2-61 Component-p-0-2-52">For some people, it stems from lost loved ones and the financial distress and social isolation the outbreak has caused. Experts say Americans are also feeling anxiety over the racial and political upheaval of the past few months, though the BU study was conducted before the recent tumult.</p>
<p class="Component-root-0-2-61 Component-p-0-2-52">“There is no question that many people in the U.S. and worldwide are experiencing real and often distressing emotional reactions to the COVID-19 pandemic and, in some cases, to contracting the virus,” said psychiatrist Dr. Ronald Pies, a retired professor at SUNY Upstate Medical University.</p>
<p class="Component-root-0-2-61 Component-p-0-2-52">The global outbreak has caused more than 850,000 deaths and almost 26 million confirmed infections. U.S. cases total 6 million, with about 185,000 deaths. The crisis has also thrown millions out of work, crippled the economy and forced shutdowns of bars, restaurants, theaters and gyms.</p>
<p class="Component-root-0-2-61 Component-p-0-2-52">Calls from March through July to the U.S. government-funded Disaster Distress Helpline, which offers counseling and emotional support, surged 335% from the same period last year.</p>
<p class="Component-root-0-2-61 Component-p-0-2-52">“Helpline counselors have reported callers expressing feelings of isolation and interpersonal concerns related to physical distancing such as being cut off from social supports,” said Hannah Collins, a spokeswoman for Vibrant Emotional Health, a group that runs the helpline.</p>
<p class="Component-root-0-2-61 Component-p-0-2-52">While not all calls are COVID-19-related, many people have sought help for anxiety and fear about getting the virus, distress over being diagnosed, or anguish over the illness or death of a loved one, she said.</p>
<p class="Component-root-0-2-61 Component-p-0-2-52">The BU study involved a survey of 1,440 U.S. adults questioned about depression symptoms in early April. Symptoms were most common in young adults, low-income participants and in those who reported several outbreak-related troubles, including financial problems, lost jobs or COVID-19 deaths of relatives. Almost 1,000 participants had experienced at least of three such struggles.</p>
<p class="Component-root-0-2-61 Component-p-0-2-52">The study results echo research from China early in the outbreak, and studies done during the Ebola and SARS crises and after major hurricanes and 9/11, said lead author Dr. Sandro Galea, a BU public health expert.</p>
<p class="Component-root-0-2-61 Component-p-0-2-52">The survey was done before the U.S. spike in civil unrest, including the May 24 death of George Floyd, who authorities say was killed when a Minneapolis police officer pressed a knee on his neck for several minutes. But Galea said that other studies have shown increases in depression symptoms after traumatic events and that it is likely the unrest has contributed to American angst.</p>
<p class="Component-root-0-2-61 Component-p-0-2-52">At Cityscape Counseling in Chicago, the new client caseload jumped from 95 to 148 over  two months, said executive director Chelsea Hudson. The group’s 17 therapists see about 500 clients a week, and Hudson said she has hired two more therapists to deal with the increased demand.</p>
<p class="Component-root-0-2-61 Component-p-0-2-52">“We see a lot of single young professionals. I think it’s been especially tough on them. The isolation, lack of connection, often enhances depression,” she said.</p>
<p class="Component-root-0-2-61 Component-p-0-2-52">Hudson said many clients are distressed about social justice issues. With more free time, she said, they are paying more attention to the news, and Chicago has been hit by vandalism and protests over killings by police.</p>
<p class="Component-root-0-2-61 Component-p-0-2-52">She said there is “a general consensus in the mental health field on our need to be ready to brush up on our trauma training. Right now people are still in a state of shock.”</p>
<p class="Component-root-0-2-61 Component-p-0-2-52">Wendy Zirbel of Dodge County, Wisconsin, said she developed anxiety and depression after testing positive for the virus in June. She said that was partly from getting sick — she still has breathing and memory troubles — and partly from her husband’s reaction.</p>
<p class="Component-root-0-2-61 Component-p-0-2-52">“He thought COVID was a joke and that it’s all Democrats trying to get Trump out of office,” she said. “It still hurts.”</p>
<p class="Component-root-0-2-61 Component-p-0-2-52">Zirbel, 45, said she spent days in tears, and her doctor prescribed an antidepressant.</p>
<p class="Component-root-0-2-61 Component-p-0-2-52">”It was just overwhelming for a couple of weeks. I just couldn’t function,” she said. “That’s totally not me. I’m usually the one that’s making people laugh.”</p>
<p class="Component-root-0-2-61 Component-p-0-2-52">The first therapist she called had a waiting list. She is hoping sessions with the one she found will help.</p>
<p class="Component-root-0-2-61 Component-p-0-2-52">“I need someone to help me get the tools to cope,” she said.</p>
<p class="Component-root-0-2-61 Component-p-0-2-52">Todd Creager, a Southern California therapist who specializes in relationship troubles, has upped his weekly workload from 22 hours of therapy to 30 to handle increased demand. He is seeing anxiety, depression and stress related to financial woes brought on by the pandemic. And in some cases, virus-related shutdowns have amplified existing strife.</p>
<p class="Component-root-0-2-61 Component-p-0-2-52">”In the past, people could get distracted by going to concerts and dinners. Now their problems are kind of staring them in the face,” he said. ’’I’ve heard people say, ’This pandemic has made me realize how toxic my relationship is.’”</p>
