										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Juggler Coaching Session Notes</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Client:  Jason, a wealthy 50 year-old.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After discussing <em>The Path of The Just</em>, a little after page 1, Jason took a breath, exclaiming, “This feels so good, so right. Wow. Why do I feel hungry for Torah learning?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The listener replied, “Well, why do you think?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jason nodded thoughtfully, “Maybe immortality is actually real; your light, your soul, is more of a reality than I imagined.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The response: “A soul has no use of a good steak, or even a $100Million dollars.  Maybe your soul is hungry for something else. Soul food. Soul food is: learning Torah, doing mitzvos and refining your character.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jason:  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That completely makes sense.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Question: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you had $1B and you grew it to $2B, what would your percentage of the happiness increase be?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jason&#8217;s answer: “Less than 1%”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was asked why?</span></p>
<p>Jason counters, “It just doesn’t do it. I see that now. I feel that now. It&#8217;s astonishing to be so empowered to know the strength of our soul.”</p>
<p>He reflected, <span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span>I really believe that the answer to us all, then, is to start to search the Soul…<span style="font-weight: 400;">”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The inquiry was: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“…so, when was the last time you took your wife on a date?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hubby answered, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I can’t remember.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whoa. N</span>ot the answer I was looking for.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I remarked: “</span>If she asks you to take her out, it’s too late.<span style="font-weight: 400;">”</span></p>
<p>Hubby: “So what should I do?<span style="font-weight: 400;">”</span></p>
<p>My response: <span style="font-weight: 400;">“Um, </span>ask her out. Today. For this week.<span style="font-weight: 400;">”</span></p>
<p>Hubby looked thoughtful, then inquired, “What else?<span style="font-weight: 400;">”</span></p>
<p>He seemed to open up further when I said, <span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ok, g</span>ive her a menu of three possible choices.”</p>
<p>We were off to a great start this afternoon, I thought. Very good, indeed.</p>
